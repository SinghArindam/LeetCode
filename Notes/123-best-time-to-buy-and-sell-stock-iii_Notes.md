### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock. We are given an array `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the price of the stock on the `i`-th day.

**Key Constraints:**
1.  **At most two transactions**: We can buy and sell at most twice.
2.  **No simultaneous transactions**: We must sell the stock before we can buy again. This means a transaction consists of a buy and a sell, and we cannot hold multiple stocks at the same time or buy again before selling the currently held stock.
3.  We want to maximize the total profit.
4.  If no profit can be made, the maximum profit is 0.

**Examples:**
*   `prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]` Output: `6` (Buy on day 4 (0), sell on day 6 (3) -> profit 3. Buy on day 7 (1), sell on day 8 (4) -> profit 3. Total = 6)
*   `prices = [1,2,3,4,5]` Output: `4` (Buy on day 1 (1), sell on day 5 (5) -> profit 4. One transaction is sufficient.)
*   `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]` Output: `0` (No profitable transaction possible.)

**Constraints on input size:**
*   `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`
These constraints suggest that a solution with time complexity around O(N) or O(N log N) is required. O(N^2) or higher would be too slow.

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

We will explore several approaches, ranging from a conceptual naive solution to increasingly optimized dynamic programming techniques.

#### 2.1. Naive/Brute Force Approach

**Idea:** Try every possible combination of two transactions. A transaction involves a buy day `b` and a sell day `s` where `b < s`.
For two transactions:
1.  First transaction: Buy on `day1_buy`, sell on `day1_sell` (`day1_buy < day1_sell`).
2.  Second transaction: Buy on `day2_buy`, sell on `day2_sell` (`day2_buy < day2_sell`).
3.  Constraint: `day1_sell < day2_buy` (no overlapping/simultaneous transactions).

**Algorithm:**
Iterate through all possible `day1_buy` (from 0 to N-1).
  Iterate through all possible `day1_sell` (from `day1_buy + 1` to N-1).
    Calculate `profit1 = prices[day1_sell] - prices[day1_buy]`.
    If `profit1 < 0`, continue (no profit).
    Iterate through all possible `day2_buy` (from `day1_sell + 1` to N-1).
      Iterate through all possible `day2_sell` (from `day2_buy + 1` to N-1).
        Calculate `profit2 = prices[day2_sell] - prices[day2_buy]`.
        If `profit2 < 0`, set to 0 (no profit from second transaction).
        `total_profit = profit1 + profit2`.
        Update overall maximum profit.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N^4). Four nested loops, each iterating up to N times. For N = 10^5, this is `10^20`, which is far too slow.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) (excluding input storage).

This approach is purely conceptual and not practical for the given constraints, but it helps understand the problem's structure.

#### 2.2. Dynamic Programming with Memoization (Approach 3 in code)

This is a common DP pattern for stock problems. We define states that capture the necessary information to make future decisions.

**State Definition:**
`dp(day, transactions_left, is_holding)`: Maximum profit starting from `day`, with `transactions_left` remaining transactions allowed, and a boolean `is_holding` indicating whether we currently hold a stock.

*   `day`: The current day we are considering (from `0` to `N-1`).
*   `transactions_left`: The number of *completed* buy-sell transactions we are still allowed to make (initially 2, can be 1 or 0). A transaction is counted as completed *after* a sell.
*   `is_holding`: A boolean flag: `True` if we own a stock, `False` otherwise.

**Recurrence Relation:**
At each `(day, transactions_left, is_holding)` state, we have two main choices:
1.  **Do nothing (Idle):** Move to the next day without performing any action.
    `idle_profit = dp(day + 1, transactions_left, is_holding)`

2.  **Perform an action (Buy or Sell):**
    *   **If `is_holding` is `True` (we own stock):**
        *   We can **sell** the stock today: `prices[day] + dp(day + 1, transactions_left - 1, False)`.
        *   `prices[day]` is the profit from selling.
        *   `transactions_left - 1`: One transaction is completed.
        *   `False`: We no longer hold stock.
        *   `action_profit = prices[day] + dp(day + 1, transactions_left - 1, False)`
    *   **If `is_holding` is `False` (we don't own stock):**
        *   We can **buy** the stock today: `-prices[day] + dp(day + 1, transactions_left, True)`.
        *   `-prices[day]` is the cost of buying.
        *   `transactions_left`: Buying doesn't complete a transaction, so count remains same.
        *   `True`: We now hold stock.
        *   `action_profit = -prices[day] + dp(day + 1, transactions_left, True)`

**Base Cases:**
*   If `day == N` (we've gone past the last day): We can't make any more profit. Return 0.
*   If `transactions_left == 0`: We've used up all our transactions. Return 0.

**Memoization:**
Use a dictionary `memo` to store results of `(day, transactions_left, is_holding)` states to avoid redundant computations.

**Initial Call:**
`find_max_profit(0, 2, False)` (start on day 0, 2 transactions allowed, not holding stock).

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K * 2), where N is `prices.length` and K is the maximum number of transactions (here, K=2). Since K is a constant, this simplifies to **O(N)**. Each state `(day, transactions_left, is_holding)` is computed once. There are `N` days, `K+1` values for `transactions_left` (0 to K), and 2 values for `is_holding`.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K * 2) for the memoization table. Simplifies to **O(N)**.

#### 2.3. Two-Pass Dynamic Programming (Approach 2 in code)

This approach is highly intuitive for problems with a fixed small number of transactions (especially K=2). It breaks the problem into two independent subproblems: finding the best profit for a single transaction up to a certain day, and finding the best profit for a single transaction from a certain day onwards.

**Idea:**
The two transactions must be separate. We can pick a day `i` to be the "split point". The first transaction must complete *on or before* day `i`, and the second transaction must start *on or after* day `i`. We then sum the maximum profits from these two parts and find the overall maximum sum across all possible split points.

**Algorithm:**
1.  **`left_profits` array:** `left_profits[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable by completing *at most one transaction* using `prices[0...i]`.
    *   Initialize `left_profits` with zeros.
    *   Iterate `day` from `1` to `N-1`.
    *   Keep track of `min_price_so_far` encountered up to the current day.
    *   `left_profits[day] = max(left_profits[day-1], prices[day] - min_price_so_far)`.
        *   `left_profits[day-1]` considers not making a transaction ending today, but using previous best.
        *   `prices[day] - min_price_so_far` considers selling today, having bought at `min_price_so_far`.

2.  **`right_profits` array:** `right_profits[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable by completing *at most one transaction* using `prices[i...N-1]`.
    *   Initialize `right_profits` with zeros.
    *   Iterate `day` from `N-2` down to `0`.
    *   Keep track of `max_price_so_far` encountered from the end of the array to the current day.
    *   `right_profits[day] = max(right_profits[day+1], max_price_so_far - prices[day])`.
        *   `right_profits[day+1]` considers not making a transaction starting today, but using previous best.
        *   `max_price_so_far - prices[day]` considers buying today, and selling at `max_price_so_far`.

3.  **Combine profits:**
    *   Initialize `total_max_profit = 0`.
    *   Iterate `day` from `0` to `N-1`.
    *   `total_max_profit = max(total_max_profit, left_profits[day] + right_profits[day])`.
    *   The `day` acts as the split point. It could be the day the first transaction ends, the day the second transaction begins, or any day in between. The crucial part is that `left_profits[day]` gives the max profit *up to* day `day`, and `right_profits[day]` gives max profit *from* day `day` onwards. Their sum covers all scenarios for two non-overlapping transactions.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N). Three passes over the `prices` array (one for `left_profits`, one for `right_profits`, one for combining).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) for `left_profits` and `right_profits` arrays.

#### 2.4. General K Transactions DP Table (Approach 4 in code)

This is a more generalized dynamic programming approach that can handle any fixed number of transactions `K`. For this problem, `K=2`.

**State Definition:**
`dp[k][i]`: Maximum profit achievable using at most `k` transactions up to day `i`.

**Recurrence Relation:**
For each `k` from `1` to `num_transactions` (2):
  For each `day` from `1` to `N-1`:
    `dp[k][day] = max(dp[k][day-1], prices[day] + max_balance)`
    Where `max_balance` is the maximum value of `dp[k-1][prev_day] - prices[prev_day]` for all `prev_day < day`.
    `max_balance` needs to be tracked within the inner loop:
    `max_balance = max(max_balance, dp[k-1][day] - prices[day])` (This updates `max_balance` for considering buying on day `day` for future sells in this `k`-th transaction).

**Initialization:**
*   `dp[0][i] = 0` for all `i` (0 transactions yield 0 profit).
*   `dp[k][0] = 0` for all `k` (no profit on day 0 unless already profit from `k-1` transactions - handled by `max_balance` initial value).

**Detailed steps for `dp[k][day]` calculation:**
1.  **Option 1: Don't do any transaction on day `day` using `k` transactions.**
    In this case, the profit is `dp[k][day-1]`.
2.  **Option 2: Complete the `k`-th transaction by selling on day `day`.**
    To do this, we must have bought the `k`-th stock on some previous day `j` (`j < day`).
    The profit from this `k`-th transaction is `prices[day] - prices[j]`.
    This `k`-th transaction must be preceded by `k-1` transactions completed by day `j`.
    So, the total profit would be `dp[k-1][j] + (prices[day] - prices[j])`.
    We want to maximize this for all `j < day`.
    This means we want to maximize `(dp[k-1][j] - prices[j]) + prices[day]`.
    Let `max_diff = max(dp[k-1][j] - prices[j])` for all `j < day`.
    Then the profit from this option is `max_diff + prices[day]`.

Combining these, `dp[k][day] = max(dp[k][day-1], max_diff + prices[day])`.

The `max_balance` variable in the code `max_balance = max(max_balance, profits_table[k-1][day] - prices[day])` correctly implements `max_diff`. It tracks the maximum value of `(profit from k-1 transactions up to day `x`) - (price on day `x`)` for all `x` up to the current `day`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K). Two nested loops, `k` up to `num_transactions` (2), `day` up to N. So `O(N)` since K is constant.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K) for the DP table. So `O(N)` since K is constant.

#### 2.5. Space-Optimized K Transactions / State Machine (Approach 5 in code, and Approach 1 is a special case of it)

This is the most optimized approach for a fixed `K`. It effectively reduces the space complexity of the general DP table to O(K). Approach 1 in the code is a hardcoded version of this for `K=2`.

**Idea:**
Instead of a full `dp[k][day]` table, we only need to store information about the profits associated with completing `k` transactions (or being in the process of `k`-th transaction) up to the *current* day. This is often described as a state machine.

We define two arrays of size `K+1`:
*   `buy_profits[k]`: Represents the maximum profit obtained after completing `k-1` transactions and *buying* the `k`-th stock. Since buying reduces capital, this profit will be a negative value (or a smaller positive value if previous transactions yielded profit). Initialize to `float('-inf')` for `k > 0`, `buy_profits[0]` can conceptually be 0.
*   `sell_profits[k]`: Represents the maximum profit obtained after completing `k` transactions by *selling* the `k`-th stock. Initialize to `0`.

**Algorithm:**
Iterate through each `price` in `prices`:
  For `k` from `1` to `num_transactions` (2):
    1.  **Update `buy_profits[k]`**:
        This means we are considering buying the `k`-th stock today.
        The profit *before* this purchase would be `sell_profits[k-1]` (max profit after `k-1` completed transactions).
        So, a candidate profit after buying is `sell_profits[k-1] - price`.
        We take the maximum of the current `buy_profits[k]` and this new candidate:
        `buy_profits[k] = max(buy_profits[k], sell_profits[k-1] - price)`
    2.  **Update `sell_profits[k]`**:
        This means we are considering selling the `k`-th stock today.
        The profit *before* this sale would be `buy_profits[k]` (max profit after buying the `k`-th stock).
        So, a candidate profit after selling is `buy_profits[k] + price`.
        We take the maximum of the current `sell_profits[k]` and this new candidate:
        `sell_profits[k] = max(sell_profits[k], buy_profits[k] + price)`

**Initial values:**
*   `buy_profits = [float('-inf')] * (num_transactions + 1)`
    *   `buy_profits[0]` is effectively not used or can be treated as 0 (no profit after 0 buys).
*   `sell_profits = [0] * (num_transactions + 1)`
    *   `sell_profits[0]` is 0 (0 profit for 0 transactions completed). This is crucial for `buy_profits[1]` calculation.

**Final Result:**
The maximum profit will be `sell_profits[num_transactions]`.

**How it works (intuition):**
The loops effectively simulate the best possible sequence of buy/sell actions.
`buy_profits[k]` stores the maximum *net value* (profit from previous transactions minus cost of current buy) after performing `k-1` sells and `k` buys.
`sell_profits[k]` stores the maximum *total profit* after performing `k` sells and `k` buys.

When iterating through `price`:
For `k=1`:
*   `buy_profits[1] = max(buy_profits[1], sell_profits[0] - price)`: Best profit after 0 sells and 1 buy. `sell_profits[0]` is 0. So, `buy_profits[1]` effectively tracks `-min_price_so_far` for the first transaction.
*   `sell_profits[1] = max(sell_profits[1], buy_profits[1] + price)`: Best profit after 1 sell and 1 buy. This finds the max profit for one transaction.
For `k=2`:
*   `buy_profits[2] = max(buy_profits[2], sell_profits[1] - price)`: Best profit after 1 sell (from `sell_profits[1]`) and 2 buys. This is `(max profit from 1st transaction) - (price of 2nd buy)`.
*   `sell_profits[2] = max(sell_profits[2], buy_profits[2] + price)`: Best profit after 2 sells and 2 buys. This is `(max profit after 2nd buy) + (price of 2nd sell)`.

The `k` loop must iterate from `num_transactions` down to `1` if `buy_profits[k]` depended on `buy_profits[k-1]` from the *current day's* updates, but here `buy_profits[k]` depends on `sell_profits[k-1]` (which refers to profit *before* this transaction), and `sell_profits[k]` depends on `buy_profits[k]` (from the current day's update). The given code iterates `k` from `1` to `num_transactions`, which is also correct because the `buy_profits[k]` update uses `sell_profits[k-1]` which *has already been finalized for the previous `k-1` transactions from this day or earlier days*.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K). One loop for `price` (N iterations), inner loop for `k` (K iterations). Since K=2, this is **O(N)**.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(K) for `buy_profits` and `sell_profits` arrays. Since K=2, this is **O(1)**. This is the most efficient solution in terms of space.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Provided Solution (Approach 5)

The provided solution leverages the Space-Optimized K Transactions / State Machine dynamic programming approach (referred to as Approach 5 in the code, and Approach 1 is a hardcoded variant of it for K=2).

Let's break down the logic:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        num_transactions = 2 # At most two transactions allowed

        # Initialize arrays to store maximum profits for different transaction states.
        # buy_profits[k]: Maximum profit after completing k-1 transactions and *buying* the k-th stock.
        #                  Initialized to negative infinity because buying costs money.
        # sell_profits[k]: Maximum profit after completing k transactions (i.e., *selling* the k-th stock).
        #                  Initialized to 0 because no transactions yield 0 profit.
        # Size is num_transactions + 1 to account for 0 to num_transactions.
        buy_profits = [float('-inf')] * (num_transactions + 1)
        sell_profits = [0] * (num_transactions + 1)

        # Iterate through each price in the given prices array
        for price in prices:
            # For each price, iterate through the allowed number of transactions (from 1 up to num_transactions)
            # We process from k=1 to avoid issues with sell_profits[k-1] if k=0.
            for k in range(1, num_transactions + 1):
                
                # 1. Update buy_profits[k]: Max profit after buying the k-th stock.
                #    We have two choices for buy_profits[k]:
                #    a) Keep the previously calculated best profit for buying the k-th stock.
                #    b) Make the k-th purchase *today*. This means we previously completed k-1 transactions
                #       (yielding sell_profits[k-1] profit) and now we spend 'price' to buy.
                #       So, the current profit after this buy is sell_profits[k-1] - price.
                buy_profits[k] = max(buy_profits[k], sell_profits[k - 1] - price)

                # 2. Update sell_profits[k]: Max profit after selling the k-th stock.
                #    We have two choices for sell_profits[k]:
                #    a) Keep the previously calculated best profit for selling the k-th stock.
                #    b) Make the k-th sale *today*. This means we previously bought the k-th stock
                #       (resulting in buy_profits[k] profit/cost) and now we gain 'price' by selling.
                #       So, the current total profit after this sell is buy_profits[k] + price.
                sell_profits[k] = max(sell_profits[k], buy_profits[k] + price)
        
        # The maximum profit after completing at most 'num_transactions' is stored in sell_profits[num_transactions].
        # This is because selling always yields a higher or equal profit than holding stock.
        return sell_profits[num_transactions]

```

**Explanation of Variables & Logic:**

*   `num_transactions = 2`: This is the maximum number of transactions allowed.
*   `buy_profits[k]`: This array element `buy_profits[k]` represents the maximum profit you could have *after* having completed `k-1` full transactions (buy-sell pairs) AND *then* buying your `k`-th stock. Since buying costs money, this value will often be negative (or less than a potential profit after selling). It's initialized to `float('-inf')` to ensure any actual transaction leads to a better (finite) value.
    *   Example: `buy_profits[1]` stores `max(-price_on_any_day_so_far)` because `sell_profits[0]` is initialized to 0.
    *   Example: `buy_profits[2]` stores `max(sell_profits[1] - price_on_any_day_so_far)` meaning "max profit after 1st transaction MINUS cost of buying 2nd stock".
*   `sell_profits[k]`: This array element `sell_profits[k]` represents the maximum total profit you could have *after* having completed `k` full transactions (buy-sell pairs). It's initialized to `0` because having done zero transactions (which is always an option) results in zero profit.
    *   Example: `sell_profits[1]` stores `max_profit_from_one_transaction`.
    *   Example: `sell_profits[2]` stores `max_profit_from_two_transactions`.

**How the loops work:**

1.  **Outer loop (`for price in prices`):** This iterates through each day's price. For each day, we consider the possibility of buying or selling for each allowed transaction `k`.
2.  **Inner loop (`for k in range(1, num_transactions + 1)`):**
    *   **Crucial Order:** The update for `buy_profits[k]` uses `sell_profits[k-1]`. `sell_profits[k-1]` has already been updated for the *current day* (or previous days) for the `k-1` transactions. This ensures that the `k`-th transaction is built upon a *completed* `k-1`-th transaction.
    *   The update for `sell_profits[k]` uses `buy_profits[k]`. This `buy_profits[k]` has just been updated in the current inner loop iteration (for the current `k` and `price`). This ensures that the sale profit is calculated based on the latest best buy for the `k`-th transaction.

This sequential update correctly models the dependency: to buy the `k`-th stock, you must have finished selling the `(k-1)`-th stock. To sell the `k`-th stock, you must have bought the `k`-th stock. By iterating `k` from `1` upwards, we ensure that `sell_profits[k-1]` is always the most up-to-date and correct value from the perspective of starting the `k`-th transaction.

**Example Trace (`prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]`, `num_transactions = 2`):**

Initial:
`buy_profits = [-inf, -inf, -inf]`
`sell_profits = [0, 0, 0]`

**Day 0: `price = 3`**
`k = 1`:
*   `buy_profits[1] = max(-inf, sell_profits[0] - 3) = max(-inf, 0 - 3) = -3`
*   `sell_profits[1] = max(0, buy_profits[1] + 3) = max(0, -3 + 3) = 0`
`k = 2`:
*   `buy_profits[2] = max(-inf, sell_profits[1] - 3) = max(-inf, 0 - 3) = -3`
*   `sell_profits[2] = max(0, buy_profits[2] + 3) = max(0, -3 + 3) = 0`

States after Day 0: `buy_profits = [-inf, -3, -3]`, `sell_profits = [0, 0, 0]`

**Day 1: `price = 3`**
`k = 1`:
*   `buy_profits[1] = max(-3, sell_profits[0] - 3) = max(-3, 0 - 3) = -3`
*   `sell_profits[1] = max(0, buy_profits[1] + 3) = max(0, -3 + 3) = 0`
`k = 2`:
*   `buy_profits[2] = max(-3, sell_profits[1] - 3) = max(-3, 0 - 3) = -3`
*   `sell_profits[2] = max(0, buy_profits[2] + 3) = max(0, -3 + 3) = 0`

States after Day 1: `buy_profits = [-inf, -3, -3]`, `sell_profits = [0, 0, 0]`

**Day 2: `price = 5`**
`k = 1`:
*   `buy_profits[1] = max(-3, sell_profits[0] - 5) = max(-3, -5) = -3`
*   `sell_profits[1] = max(0, buy_profits[1] + 5) = max(0, -3 + 5) = 2` (Buy at 3, sell at 5. Profit 2)
`k = 2`:
*   `buy_profits[2] = max(-3, sell_profits[1] - 5) = max(-3, 2 - 5) = -3` (Profit of 2 from 1st trans, then buy at 5. Net -3)
*   `sell_profits[2] = max(0, buy_profits[2] + 5) = max(0, -3 + 5) = 2` (Can't make 2nd profit yet. Max profit is still 2 from first transaction)

States after Day 2: `buy_profits = [-inf, -3, -3]`, `sell_profits = [0, 2, 2]`

...and so on. The logic correctly carries forward the max profits. The final `sell_profits[2]` will hold the maximum profit for at most two transactions.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Each Approach

*   **Naive/Brute Force (Conceptual):**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N^4)
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(1)

*   **Dynamic Programming with Memoization (Approach 3):**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is `prices.length` and K is `num_transactions` (2). Since K is a constant, this is **O(N)**.
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K) for the memoization table. Since K is a constant, this is **O(N)**.

*   **Two-Pass Dynamic Programming (Approach 2):**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N). Three passes over the array (one left-to-right, one right-to-left, one for combination).
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(N) for `left_profits` and `right_profits` arrays.

*   **General K Transactions DP Table (Approach 4):**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K). Two nested loops. Since K is a constant, this is **O(N)**.
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(N * K) for the DP table. Since K is a constant, this is **O(N)**.

*   **Space-Optimized K Transactions / State Machine (Approach 5 - Optimal):**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K). One loop over prices (N iterations), inner loop over K transactions (K iterations). Since K is a constant (2), this is **O(N)**.
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(K) for `buy_profits` and `sell_profits` arrays. Since K is a constant (2), this is **O(1)**.

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

1.  **Empty `prices` array (`prices = []`):**
    *   The code explicitly handles this with `if not prices: return 0`. This is correct, as no transactions can be made.
2.  **`prices.length < 2` (e.g., `prices = [7]`):**
    *   If there's only one day, you cannot buy and then sell. The loops in the optimal solution will run for `N=1` iteration. `buy_profits` will remain `float('-inf')` for `k=1,2`, and `sell_profits` will remain `0` for `k=1,2`. The final `sell_profits[2]` will correctly return `0`.
3.  **Decreasing prices (`prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`):**
    *   No profitable transaction is possible.
    *   In the optimal solution, `buy_profits[k]` will become `-price` (or remain `-inf`) and `sell_profits[k]` will never exceed `0` because `buy_profits[k] + price` will be `0` or negative. The final `sell_profits[2]` will correctly be `0`.
4.  **All same prices (`prices = [5,5,5,5]`):**
    *   Similar to decreasing prices, no profit can be made. `sell_profits[2]` will be `0`.
5.  **Small `prices.length` (e.g., length 2 or 3):**
    *   The algorithms adapt naturally.
    *   If `prices = [1, 5]` (N=2): `sell_profits[1]` will become 4, `sell_profits[2]` will become 4. Correct.
    *   If `prices = [1, 2, 1, 5]` (N=4): This involves finding one optimal transaction for [1,2] (profit 1) and another for [1,5] (profit 4). The state machine handles the chaining correctly.

The initialization values (`float('-inf')` for `buy_profits` and `0` for `sell_profits`) are crucial. `float('-inf')` ensures that any valid purchase price will update `buy_profits`, representing a potential starting point for a transaction. `0` for `sell_profits` represents the base case of making no profit or no transactions.

### 6. Clean, Well-Commented Version of the Optimal Solution

The provided solution (Approach 5) is indeed the optimal one.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the maximum profit achievable by completing at most two transactions.

        This solution uses a space-optimized dynamic programming approach (state machine).
        It tracks the maximum profit at different stages of up to 'num_transactions' transactions.

        Args:
            prices: A list of integers where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.

        Returns:
            The maximum profit that can be achieved.
        """

        # Handle edge case: if prices list is empty, no transactions can be made.
        if not prices:
            return 0

        # Define the maximum number of transactions allowed.
        # For this problem, it's explicitly stated as at most two transactions.
        num_transactions = 2

        # Initialize two arrays to store the maximum profits at different states:
        #
        # 1. buy_profits[k]:
        #    Represents the maximum profit (or minimum cost/net value) after completing
        #    (k-1) full transactions AND THEN buying the k-th stock.
        #    Since buying costs money, these values start as negative infinity to ensure
        #    any actual purchase updates them.
        #    - buy_profits[0] is not used in the loop, but conceptual max profit after 0 buys.
        #    - buy_profits[1] means max profit after buying the 1st stock.

        #    Represents the maximum total profit after completing 'k' full transactions
        #    (i.e., after selling the k-th stock).
        #    Initialized to 0 because doing zero transactions results in zero profit.
        #    - sell_profits[0] is the base case: 0 profit with 0 transactions.
        #    - sell_profits[1] means max profit after selling the 1st stock.
        #    - sell_profits[2] means max profit after selling the 2nd stock.
        sell_profits = [0] * (num_transactions + 1)

        # Iterate through each daily stock price
        for price in prices:
            # Iterate through the number of transactions allowed, from 1 up to the maximum.
            # This order ensures that sell_profits[k-1] (required for buy_profits[k])
            # is already finalized for the previous transaction stage.
            for k in range(1, num_transactions + 1):
                
                # --- Update buy_profits[k] ---
                # We want to find the maximum possible profit (or least negative value)
                # if we were to buy our k-th stock today at 'price'.
                #
                # Two possibilities:
                # 1. We keep the best 'buy_profits[k]' value calculated so far from previous days.
                # 2. We buy the k-th stock today:
                #    - We must have completed (k-1) transactions already. The profit from those
                #      (k-1) transactions is sell_profits[k-1].
                #    - We then spend 'price' to buy the k-th stock.
                #    - So, the new candidate profit is sell_profits[k-1] - price.
                # We take the maximum of these two possibilities.
                buy_profits[k] = max(buy_profits[k], sell_profits[k - 1] - price)

                # 2. We sell the k-th stock today:
                #    - We must have bought the k-th stock previously, resulting in 'buy_profits[k]'
                #      (this 'buy_profits[k]' is the *most updated* value for the current day).
                #    - We then gain 'price' by selling the stock.
                #    - So, the new candidate total profit is buy_profits[k] + price.

                sell_profits[k] = max(sell_profits[k], buy_profits[k] + price)
        
        # After iterating through all prices, the maximum profit achievable with at most
        # 'num_transactions' (i.e., 2) is stored in sell_profits[num_transactions].
        # This is because the final action for profit is always selling.
        return sell_profits[num_transactions]

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns for Similar Problems

This problem is a classic dynamic programming problem in the "stock trading" series on LeetCode. Understanding its solution helps with many variations:

1.  **Dynamic Programming State Definition:**
    *   Many stock problems can be solved using DP where the state often involves:
        *   `current_day`: The index of the day being considered.
        *   `transactions_remaining` (or `transactions_done`): How many more transactions are allowed/completed.
        *   `holding_stock`: A boolean indicating if you currently own a stock.
    *   The number of states (and thus complexity) depends on the range of these variables.

2.  **Fixed Number of Transactions (K):**
    *   When the maximum number of transactions (`K`) is a small, fixed constant (like `K=2` here), the O(N\*K) time complexity becomes O(N).
    *   Crucially, the O(N\*K) space complexity can often be reduced to O(K) (or even O(1) if K is very small) using a "state machine" or "space-optimized DP". This involves only keeping track of the `K` relevant `buy` and `sell` states from the previous iteration, rather than the full `N x K` DP table.

3.  **State Machine DP (`buy_k`, `sell_k` variables):**
    *   This pattern is extremely powerful. `buy_k` typically represents the maximum profit *after* completing `k-1` transactions and *then* buying the `k`-th stock. `sell_k` represents the maximum profit *after* completing `k` transactions.
    *   The updates typically follow:
        *   `buy_k = max(buy_k, sell_{k-1} - price)` (buying now, after previous transactions)
        *   `sell_k = max(sell_k, buy_k + price)` (selling now, after current buy)
    *   The initialization (`sell_0 = 0`, `buy_k = -infinity`) and update order are critical.
    *   This is applicable to:
        *   "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock I" (K=1, essentially `sell_1`)
        *   "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II" (Unlimited transactions, can be viewed as K approaches infinity, or a greedy approach of summing all positive price differences)
        *   "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV" (General K transactions)
        *   "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown" (adds a cooldown state)
        *   "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee" (modifies transaction costs)

4.  **Decomposition (Two-Pass DP):**
    *   For `K=2`, the two-pass DP approach is elegant. It breaks the problem into finding the best first transaction `[0...i]` and the best second transaction `[i...N-1]`. This concept of splitting the problem can be useful when direct DP states become too complex for a specific `K`.

5.  **Handling Buy/Sell Constraints:**
    *   "Must sell before buying again": This is inherently handled by `buy_k` depending on `sell_{k-1}`. You can only start the `k`-th transaction (buy) after the `(k-1)`-th transaction is completed (sold).
    *   Profit calculations: Always `sell_price - buy_price`. Cost of buying is negative. Profit from selling is positive.

By understanding these patterns and the state machine approach, one can tackle a wide array of stock trading problems efficiently.
