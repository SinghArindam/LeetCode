### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to count the number of "land cells" (represented by `1`) in a given `m x n` binary matrix `grid` that **cannot** "walk off the boundary" of the grid. A "sea cell" is represented by `0`.

A "move" is defined as walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally: up, down, left, right) land cell, or walking off the boundary of the grid.

Essentially, we need to find all connected components of land cells that are completely "enclosed" by sea cells (`0`) or the grid boundaries, such that no land cell within that component is adjacent to a boundary cell (row 0, row `m-1`, col 0, or col `n-1`) or can reach one through other land cells.

---

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

This problem is a classic graph traversal problem on a grid, specifically a variation of "flood fill" or "connected components". The core idea revolves around distinguishing land cells reachable from the boundary from those that are not.

#### Approach 1: Traverse Each Island (DFS/BFS - Provided, Commented Out)

This approach iterates through every cell in the grid. If it encounters an unvisited land cell (`1`), it starts a traversal (DFS or BFS) to find all connected land cells forming an "island". During this traversal, it keeps track of:
1.  The `size` of the current island (number of land cells).
2.  Whether `is_boundary_island`: if any cell in the current island is on the grid boundary (first/last row or first/last column).
After the traversal for an island completes, if `is_boundary_island` is `False`, it means this entire island is an "enclave" (cannot reach the boundary), and its `size` is added to the total count.

**Logic:**
*   Initialize `visited_cells` set to keep track of visited land cells.
*   Initialize `enclaved_land_cells = 0`.
*   Iterate `row_idx` from 0 to `num_rows - 1` and `col_idx` from 0 to `num_cols - 1`.
*   If `grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 1` and `(row_idx, col_idx)` is not in `visited_cells`:
    *   Start a new DFS/BFS traversal from `(row_idx, col_idx)`.
    *   Maintain `current_island_size = 0` and `current_island_is_boundary = False`.
    *   Use a stack (for DFS) or queue (for BFS) for traversal. Add `(row_idx, col_idx)` to it and to `visited_cells`.
    *   While the stack/queue is not empty:
        *   Pop/dequeue a cell `(r, c)`.
        *   Increment `current_island_size`.
        *   Check if `(r, c)` is on the boundary. If so, set `current_island_is_boundary = True`.
        *   Explore 4-directionally adjacent cells `(nr, nc)`.
        *   If `(nr, nc)` is valid (within bounds), is a land cell (`1`), and not visited: add it to `visited_cells` and the stack/queue.
    *   After the traversal, if `current_island_is_boundary` is `False`, add `current_island_size` to `enclaved_land_cells`.
*   Return `enclaved_land_cells`.

#### Approach 2: Flood Fill from Borders (DFS - Provided, Active Optimal Solution)

This is a more efficient and standard approach for such problems. The core idea is: **any land cell that can "walk off the boundary" must be connected to a land cell that is *on* the boundary.** Therefore, we can find all land cells connected to the boundary and "mark them" (e.g., change `1` to `0`, or `2`, or add to a `visited` set). The remaining unvisited `1`s will be the enclaved cells.

**Logic:**
1.  **Mark boundary-reachable land cells:**
    *   Iterate through all cells on the **first and last rows** (i.e., `grid[0][col]` for all `col`, and `grid[max_row-1][col]` for all `col`). If a cell is `1`, perform a DFS (or BFS) starting from it. During the DFS, change all reachable `1`s to `0` (or another marker like `2`) to indicate they are reachable from the boundary.
    *   Similarly, iterate through all cells on the **first and last columns** (i.e., `grid[row][0]` for all `row`, and `grid[row][max_col-1]` for all `row`). If a cell is `1` and hasn't been marked yet, perform DFS/BFS to mark all reachable `1`s.
    *   **Important:** When iterating through columns, remember to check `grid[0][c]` and `grid[max_row-1][c]`. When iterating through rows, check `grid[r][0]` and `grid[r][max_col-1]`. The corners will be visited twice, which is fine as DFS/BFS handles visited cells.
2.  **Count remaining enclaved cells:**
    *   After marking all boundary-reachable land cells, iterate through the entire grid again.
    *   Sum up all remaining `1`s. These are the land cells that could not be reached from the boundary, hence they are enclaved.

**Implementation detail (DFS `sink_island` function):**
*   Base cases for `sink_island(row, col)`:
    *   If `(row, col)` is out of bounds, return.
    *   If `grid[row][col]` is `0` (sea cell or already visited/sunk), return.
*   Recursive step:
    *   Set `grid[row][col] = 0` (mark as sunk/visited).
    *   Recursively call `sink_island` for its 4-directional neighbors.

#### Approach 3: BFS from Borders (Provided, Commented Out)

This approach is functionally identical to Approach 2 but uses BFS instead of DFS. It collects all initial boundary `1`s into a queue and then processes them in a BFS manner, marking all reachable `1`s.

**Logic:**
1.  Initialize a `deque` (queue) `walkable_land`.
2.  Iterate through all cells of the grid. If a cell `(r, c)` is a land cell (`1`) AND is on the border, add it to `walkable_land` and change `grid[r][c]` to `0` (or `2`) to mark it as visited and "sunk".
3.  While `walkable_land` is not empty:
    *   Dequeue `(row, col)`.
    *   For each of its 4-directional neighbors `(next_row, next_col)`:
        *   If `(next_row, next_col)` is valid, and `grid[next_row][next_col] == 1`:
            *   Change `grid[next_row][next_col]` to `0` (mark as sunk).
            *   Enqueue `(next_row, next_col)`.
4.  After the BFS completes, all land cells reachable from the boundary will have been changed to `0`. Sum the remaining `1`s in the grid.

#### Approach 4: DFS from Borders (Count and Subtract - Provided, Commented Out)

This is another variation of the "flood fill from borders" strategy. Instead of modifying the grid in place by changing `1`s to `0`s, it uses a `visited` set (or similar mechanism) to keep track of reachable land cells. It calculates the total land cells initially, then subtracts the count of land cells reachable from the border.

**Logic:**
1.  Calculate `total_land_mass` by summing all `1`s in the original grid.
2.  Initialize `explored_area` (a `set` of `(r, c)` tuples) to keep track of visited land cells during border traversal.
3.  Initialize `edge_land_mass = 0`.
4.  Define a recursive `find_connected_land(r, c)` function:
    *   Base cases: out of bounds, `grid[r][c] == 0`, or `(r, c)` already in `explored_area`. Return `0`.
    *   Add `(r, c)` to `explored_area`.
    *   Return `1` (for current cell) + sum of recursive calls for 4 neighbors.
5.  Iterate through all boundary cells (first/last row, first/last column).
    *   If a boundary cell `(r, c)` is a `1` and not in `explored_area`:
        *   Call `edge_land_mass += find_connected_land(r, c)`.
6.  The result is `total_land_mass - edge_land_mass`.

#### Approach 5: Disjoint Set Union (DSU - Provided, Commented Out)

DSU can model connectivity. Each land cell `(r, c)` can be represented by a unique integer ID (e.g., `r * cols + c`). We also introduce a special "border node" ID.
**Logic:**
1.  Initialize DSU data structures: `parent` array (each cell initially its own parent) and `size` array (each component initially size 1).
2.  Define `find_root` (with path compression) and `union_sets` (with union by size/rank) operations.
3.  Add a special `border_node` (e.g., `rows * cols`) to represent connectivity to the boundary.
4.  Iterate through each cell `(r_idx, c_idx)` in the grid:
    *   If `grid[r_idx][c_idx] == 1`:
        *   Calculate `cell_index = r_idx * cols + c_idx`.
        *   If `(r_idx, c_idx)` is on the boundary, `union_sets(cell_index, border_node)`.
        *   For each 4-directional neighbor `(next_r, next_c)`:
            *   If `(next_r, next_c)` is valid and `grid[next_r][next_c] == 1`:
                *   Calculate `neighbor_index = next_r * cols + next_c`.
                *   `union_sets(cell_index, neighbor_index)`.
5.  After processing all cells and their neighbors, find the `border_root = find_root(border_node)`.
6.  Iterate through the grid again. For each land cell `(r_idx, c_idx)`:
    *   If `grid[r_idx][c_idx] == 1`:
        *   Calculate `cell_index = r_idx * cols + c_idx`.
        *   If `find_root(cell_index) != border_root`, increment `enclave_cell_count`.
7.  Return `enclave_cell_count`.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Logic & Alternatives

The problem's core requirement is to identify land cells *not* reachable from the boundary. This directly implies identifying land cells *reachable* from the boundary and excluding them.

#### Logic behind Approach 2 (Optimal Provided Solution - DFS Flood Fill from Borders)

The provided optimal solution uses a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) for its flood-fill mechanism.

1.  **Identify "reachable" cells:** The key insight is that any land cell that can "walk off the boundary" must be part of a connected component of land cells that includes at least one cell on the grid's border (row 0, row `m-1`, col 0, or col `n-1`).
2.  **Marking/Sinking:** The `sink_island` function effectively performs a DFS.
    *   It takes `row` and `col` as arguments.
    *   Its base cases ensure it only processes valid land cells (`1`) that are within bounds. If a cell is `0` (already sea or already "sunk") or out of bounds, it stops.
    *   If it's a `1` and valid, it changes `grid[row][col]` to `0`. This is the "sinking" part â€“ marking the cell as processed and effectively removing it from the grid for the final count.
    *   Then, it recursively calls itself for all four neighbors. This continues the "flood" until all connected `1`s are turned into `0`s.
3.  **Initiating the flood:** The main part of `numEnclaves` calls `sink_island` for all cells on the border:
    *   `for r_idx in range(max_row): sink_island(r_idx, 0); sink_island(r_idx, max_col - 1)`: Sinks land cells connected to the first and last columns.
    *   `for c_idx in range(max_col): sink_island(0, c_idx); sink_island(max_row - 1, c_idx)`: Sinks land cells connected to the first and last rows.
    *   Notice that corner cells (e.g., `(0,0)`, `(0, max_col-1)`) will be called twice, but `sink_island` handles this gracefully by immediately returning if `grid[r][c]` is already `0`.
4.  **Final Count:** After all border-reachable land cells (and their connected components) are turned to `0`, the grid will only contain `1`s that are truly enclaved. A simple `sum(sum(row_data) for row_data in grid)` counts these remaining `1`s.

#### Alternatives & Why Approach 2 is Preferred:

*   **Approach 1 (Iterate each island):** This approach is less optimal. It performs a separate DFS/BFS for *each* unvisited land cell. While it eventually visits all cells, if the grid is sparse with many small islands, it incurs overhead for starting many traversals. More importantly, it requires explicitly storing `visited_cells` in a `set` (or modifying the grid), and for each island, accumulating its size and checking its boundary status. The "flood from border" approach implicitly handles visited cells by marking them `0`, and directly focuses on the irrelevant components first.
*   **Approach 3 (BFS from Borders):** This is functionally equivalent to Approach 2. BFS uses a queue instead of recursion, which can be advantageous in languages with strict recursion depth limits or for very large grids to avoid `RecursionError`. For Python and typical LeetCode constraints (M, N <= 500), DFS is usually fine. Performance-wise, they are very similar.
*   **Approach 4 (DFS from Borders - Count and Subtract):** This is also functionally equivalent to Approach 2/3. Instead of modifying the grid in-place, it uses a `set` to track visited cells during the border traversal. It then subtracts the count of these visited border-reachable cells from the total initial land count. This is a good alternative if modifying the input grid is undesirable. Performance is similar, with the `set` potentially having slightly more overhead than in-place modification for very large grids, but often negligible.
*   **Approach 5 (DSU):** DSU is a powerful data structure for connectivity problems. While it can solve this problem, it's generally an overkill for static grid connectivity where DFS/BFS provide a simpler and often more performant solution. The overhead of managing parent and size arrays, and the `find` and `union` operations, typically makes it slower than direct graph traversal on grids unless specific DSU properties (like dynamic updates) are needed. For this problem, DFS/BFS are more direct.

**Conclusion on optimal approach:** Approaches 2, 3, and 4 are all efficient and valid solutions using the "flood fill from borders" strategy. Approach 2 (DFS in-place modification) is often concise and commonly used in competitive programming. Approach 3 (BFS in-place modification) is safer for very deep recursion. Approach 4 (DFS with `visited` set and subtraction) is good if the original grid needs to remain untouched. The provided active solution is Approach 2.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Let `M` be the number of rows and `N` be the number of columns in the `grid`.

#### Approach 1: Traverse Each Island (DFS/BFS)
*   **Time Complexity:** O(M * N). In the worst case, every cell is visited exactly once. Even if separate traversals are initiated for different islands, each land cell and its connections are processed only once because of the `visited_cells` set. Each cell is added to `visited_cells` and processed from the stack/queue once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M * N).
    *   `visited_cells` set: In the worst case, all cells are land cells, so the set stores up to `M * N` tuples.
    *   Recursion stack (for DFS) or queue (for BFS): In the worst case (a single large island), the stack/queue can hold up to `M * N` elements.

#### Approach 2: Flood Fill from Borders (DFS - Optimal)
*   **Time Complexity:** O(M * N).
    *   The initial loops iterate over all border cells (2 * M + 2 * N - 4 cells).
    *   Each `sink_island` call (DFS) visits each connected land cell at most once because it changes `1` to `0`, preventing revisits. So, all cells reachable from the border are visited once.
    *   The final `sum` loop iterates over all `M * N` cells once.
    *   Overall, each cell is processed a constant number of times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M * N).
    *   Recursion stack: In the worst case (e.g., a grid full of `1`s forming a snake-like path), the DFS recursion depth can go up to `M * N`.

#### Approach 3: BFS from Borders
*   **Time Complexity:** O(M * N). Similar to DFS, each cell is visited at most a constant number of times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M * N).
    *   `walkable_land` queue: In the worst case (e.g., a grid full of `1`s), the queue can hold up to `M * N` elements.

#### Approach 4: DFS from Borders (Count and Subtract)
*   **Time Complexity:** O(M * N).
    *   Initial `sum` for `total_land_mass`: O(M * N).
    *   Border traversals and `find_connected_land` calls: Each land cell reachable from the border is visited and added to `explored_area` once. Total work here is O(M * N).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M * N).
    *   `explored_area` set: Stores up to `M * N` tuples.
    *   Recursion stack for `find_connected_land`: Up to `M * N` depth in worst case.

#### Approach 5: Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
*   **Time Complexity:** O(M * N * Î±(M*N)), where Î± is the inverse Ackermann function, which is practically constant and very small.
    *   Iterating through cells and performing `union_sets` operations: Each `union` and `find` operation takes nearly constant time on average with path compression and union by size/rank. We perform O(M*N) unions and finds.
    *   Final iteration to count enclaves: O(M*N) finds.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M * N).
    *   `parent` array and `size` array: Store `M * N + 1` elements.

**Summary:** All efficient approaches (2, 3, 4, 5) have a time complexity of O(M*N) and space complexity of O(M*N). The DFS/BFS approaches (2, 3, 4) are generally simpler to implement and have slightly better constant factors than DSU for grid problems. Approach 2 (in-place DFS) is a common and highly effective solution.

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

*   **Empty Grid:** `grid = []` or `grid = [[]]`.
    *   The code correctly handles `max_row = len(grid)`. If `max_row == 0`, it returns `0`. This covers `[]`.
    *   If `grid = [[]]`, then `max_row = 1`, `max_col = 0`. The `if max_col == 0` check (implicitly or explicitly handled by `len(grid[0])`) would return 0 as well. This is good.
*   **Grid with 1 row or 1 column:** (e.g., `[[1,1,1]]` or `[[1],[1],[1]]`)
    *   All `1`s in such grids are by definition on the boundary. The `sink_island` function will be called on all of them from the border loops. Consequently, all `1`s will be turned to `0`s, and the final count will be `0`, which is correct as no land cell can be enclaved in a 1-dimensional grid.
*   **Grid with no land cells (`0`s only):**
    *   The `sink_island` function will never be called (as it's only called on `1`s), or if called on a `0`, it will immediately return. The sum of the grid will remain `0`, which is correct.
*   **Grid full of land cells (`1`s only):**
    *   All cells are `1`s. The border cells will initiate `sink_island`. Since all cells are connected, the entire grid will be turned to `0`s. The final sum will be `0`, which is correct as all land cells can reach the boundary.
*   **All land cells are connected to the boundary (Example 2):**
    *   Similar to the "grid full of 1s" case. The border flood-fill will reach all `1`s and turn them into `0`s. The final count will be `0`, correct.
*   **All land cells are enclaved (e.g., `[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`):**
    *   The border cells are all `0`s. `sink_island` will not be called on any border land cells. The `1` in the middle will remain a `1`. The final sum will be `1`, which is correct.
*   **Disconnected land masses:**
    *   The algorithm correctly handles disconnected land masses. Only those connected to the border will be sunk. Disconnected enclaved land masses will remain untouched and be counted.

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

*   **Graph Traversal on Grids:** Many grid-based problems can be modeled as graph problems where cells are nodes and adjacency (4-directional or 8-directional) defines edges. DFS and BFS are fundamental algorithms for traversing such graphs.
*   **Flood Fill Technique:** This problem is a classic application of the "flood fill" algorithm. When you need to identify or modify all connected components from a starting point (or set of starting points), flood fill (using DFS or BFS) is the go-to method.
*   **Identifying "Unreachable" Elements by Marking "Reachable" Ones:** A common strategy for problems asking to count elements that *cannot* reach a certain state/boundary/target is to first identify and mark/remove all elements that *can* reach that state/boundary/target. The remaining elements are then the answer. This inverse logic often simplifies the problem significantly.
*   **Boundary Conditions are Key:** In grid problems, cells on the boundary often have special properties or serve as starting points for specific traversals. Always pay close attention to `row == 0`, `row == M-1`, `col == 0`, `col == N-1`.
*   **In-place Modification vs. Visited Set:** For grid traversal problems, you often have two choices to prevent revisiting cells:
    1.  **Modify the grid in-place:** Change the cell value (e.g., `1` to `0`, or `0` to `2`) once visited. This is efficient for space but alters the input grid.
    2.  **Use a separate `visited` set/array:** Store coordinates of visited cells. This preserves the original grid but adds space overhead for the `visited` structure. Both are valid, choose based on problem constraints or style preference.
*   **Recursion Depth:** Be mindful of recursion depth limits when using DFS for large grids. Python has a default limit (usually 1000 or 3000). For competitive programming, if `M*N` is very large (e.g., > 10^5), an iterative BFS (using a `deque`) is generally safer than recursive DFS. For `M, N <= 500`, `M*N <= 250000`, Python's default recursion limit might need to be increased (e.g., `sys.setrecursionlimit(...)`), or BFS is a safer bet.
*   **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for Connectivity:** While not the most straightforward for this problem, DSU is a powerful alternative for connectivity problems, especially if there are dynamic updates (adding/removing cells, changing land/water) or complex group operations. It's good to be aware of it as a general tool for connected component problems.
