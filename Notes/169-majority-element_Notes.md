### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to find the "majority element" in a given integer array `nums` of size `n`. The majority element is defined as the element that appears *more than* `⌊n / 2⌋` times. A crucial guarantee is provided: the majority element *always exists* in the array.

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
*   `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in linear time (O(N)) and constant space (O(1))?

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

We'll explore several approaches, starting from less efficient ones and moving towards the most optimized solution.

#### A. Approach 1: Brute-Force Counting

**Concept:** For each unique element in the array, count its occurrences throughout the entire array. If an element's count exceeds `n/2`, it is the majority element.

**Logic:**
1.  Initialize `majority_count = n // 2`.
2.  Iterate through each element `num` in `nums`.
3.  For each `num`, iterate through `nums` again to count its occurrences.
4.  If `current_count > majority_count`, `num` is the majority element. Return it.

#### B. Approach 2: Sorting

**Concept:** If the array is sorted, the majority element (which appears more than `n/2` times) must occupy the middle position (`n/2` index, 0-indexed). This is because if an element appears more than `n/2` times, it will necessarily "spill over" the exact middle point of the sorted array.

**Logic:**
1.  Sort the `nums` array.
2.  The element at index `n // 2` (integer division) will be the majority element. Return `nums[n // 2]`.

#### C. Approach 3: Hash Map (Frequency Counter)

**Concept:** Use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the frequency of each element in the array. After counting all frequencies, iterate through the hash map to find the element with the highest count. Since the majority element is guaranteed to exist and appears more than `n/2` times, it will naturally have the highest count.

**Logic:**
1.  Initialize an empty hash map `counts`.
2.  Iterate through `nums`: for each `num`, increment its count in `counts`. If `num` is not in `counts`, initialize its count to 1.
3.  After iterating through all elements, iterate through the `counts` hash map.
4.  Find the key (element) that has a value (count) greater than `n // 2`. Return this key.
    *   Alternatively, find the key with the maximum value.

#### D. Approach 4: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm (Optimal)

**Concept:** This algorithm is specifically designed for finding a majority element in linear time and constant space. It works on the principle that if we pair up each occurrence of an element with an occurrence of a *different* element, the majority element will be the only one left standing after all such pairings.

**Logic:**
1.  Initialize `candidate` to `None` and `count` to `0`.
2.  Iterate through each `num` in `nums`:
    *   If `count` is `0`, it means the previous `candidate` has been "outvoted" or no candidate has been chosen yet. Set `candidate = num` and `count = 1`.
    *   If `num` is equal to `candidate`, increment `count`.
    *   If `num` is different from `candidate`, decrement `count`.
3.  After the loop, `candidate` will hold the majority element. Return `candidate`.

*Why it works:* Each time `count` is decremented, it's like cancelling out one instance of the current `candidate` with one instance of a different element. Since the majority element appears more than `n/2` times, its net count will always be positive and it will be the last `candidate` remaining with a non-zero count (it might be 1, 2, or more, but definitely positive).

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Provided Solution and Alternative Approaches

**Provided Solution Analysis:**

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        d = dict()
        for num in nums:
            if num not in d.keys():
                d[num] = nums.count(num) # This line is the critical point
        majority_element = max(d, key=d.get)
        return majority_element
```

The provided solution attempts to use a hash map, but it has a significant inefficiency:

1.  `d = dict()`: Initializes an empty dictionary.
2.  `for num in nums:`: It iterates through each element in the input list `nums`.
3.  `if num not in d.keys():`: This check is to ensure that `nums.count(num)` is called only once for each *unique* number.
4.  `d[num] = nums.count(num)`: **This is the bottleneck.** `nums.count(num)` iterates through the *entire `nums` list* to count occurrences of `num`. If there are `U` unique numbers in `nums`, and `n` is the total length, this line will be executed `U` times. In the worst case, `U` can be `n` (all elements unique), leading to `n` calls to `nums.count(num)`. Each `nums.count` call is O(N). Therefore, this part becomes O(N * N) = O(N^2).
5.  `majority_element = max(d, key=d.get)`: After populating the dictionary, this finds the key (element) with the maximum value (count). This operation is O(U) where U is the number of unique elements, worst case O(N).

**Overall, the provided solution is O(N^2) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.** This is not optimal and fails the "linear time" follow-up.

**Alternative Approaches (Reiteration):**

*   **Correct Hash Map Approach (O(N) Time, O(N) Space):**
    A more efficient way to use a hash map would be to increment counts iteratively:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            counts = {}
            n = len(nums)
            for num in nums:
                counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1 # Increment count or initialize to 1
                if counts[num] > n // 2: # Early exit optimization
                    return num
            # Fallback if no early exit (guaranteed to find one eventually)
            # return max(counts, key=counts.get)
    ```
    This version iterates through `nums` only once to build counts, making it O(N) time. The `max` operation is also O(N) in worst case (unique elements). The space complexity is O(N) for the dictionary in the worst case (all unique elements).

*   **Sorting Approach (O(N log N) Time, O(1) or O(N) Space):**
    As discussed, sorting takes O(N log N) time. Python's `list.sort()` is typically Timsort, which takes O(N) auxiliary space in the worst case. If the sorting is done in-place with O(1) auxiliary space (e.g., Heapsort), then the space complexity could be O(1). However, for typical language built-in sorts, O(N) space is a safer assumption. This approach is better than the provided solution but not linear time.

*   **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm (O(N) Time, O(1) Space):**
    This is the truly optimal solution and fulfills the follow-up requirement. It iterates through the array once and uses only a few variables, leading to O(N) time and O(1) space.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Each Approach

| Approach                       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes                                                               |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A. Brute-Force Counting        | O(N^2)          | O(1)             | Nested loops, `nums.count` is effectively this for one element.     |
| B. Sorting                     | O(N log N)      | O(N) (or O(1) if in-place) | Python's `list.sort()` uses O(N) space in worst-case.              |
| C. Hash Map (Provided Solution) | O(N^2)          | O(N)             | Due to repeated `nums.count(num)` calls inside the loop.            |
| C. Hash Map (Corrected)        | O(N)            | O(N)             | Single pass to build counts.                                        |
| D. Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm | O(N)            | O(1)             | Single pass, constant extra variables. **Optimal.**                 |

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

*   **`n = 1`:** The problem states `1 <= n`. If `n=1`, `nums = [x]`.
    *   Brute-Force: Counts `x` as 1, `1 > 1//2` (0), so returns `x`.
    *   Sorting: `nums[0]` is `x`. Returns `x`.
    *   Hash Map (Provided/Corrected): Adds `x` with count 1. `max(d, key=d.get)` returns `x`.
    *   Boyer-Moore: `candidate` becomes `x`, `count` becomes 1. Loop ends, returns `x`.
    All approaches correctly handle `n=1`.

*   **All elements are the same:** e.g., `nums = [7, 7, 7, 7]`.
    *   All approaches will correctly identify 7 as the majority element. Boyer-Moore is particularly efficient here, incrementing count for 7 throughout.

*   **Majority element at beginning/middle/end:** The position of the majority element does not affect the correctness of any of the discussed algorithms. Sorting handles it by bringing it to the center. Hash maps don't care about order. Boyer-Moore dynamically adjusts its candidate.

*   **Guaranteed Majority Element:** The problem statement explicitly guarantees that "the majority element always exists in the array." This simplifies the problem significantly because:
    *   We don't need to handle cases where no such element exists (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).
    *   For Boyer-Moore, we don't need a second pass to verify the found candidate (which is sometimes required if the majority element isn't guaranteed). The candidate found at the end of the first pass *is* guaranteed to be the majority element due to the `> n/2` property.

### 6. Clean, Well-Commented Version of the Optimal Solution

The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is the optimal solution as it achieves O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Finds the majority element in an array using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.
        The majority element is guaranteed to exist and appears more than floor(n / 2) times.

        Args:
            nums: A list of integers.

        Returns:
            The majority element.
        """
        
        # Initialize a candidate and a counter.
        # The candidate will hold the potential majority element.
        # The counter tracks the "vote" for the current candidate.
        candidate = None
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate through each number in the input list.
        for num in nums:
            # If the count is 0, it means the previous candidate has been "outvoted"
            # or we are at the beginning. A new candidate emerges.
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
                count = 1
            # If the current number is the same as the candidate,
            # it "votes" for the candidate, increasing its count.
            elif num == candidate:
                count += 1
            # If the current number is different from the candidate,
            # it "votes" against the candidate, decreasing its count.
            else:
                count -= 1
        
        # After iterating through the entire array, the 'candidate' variable
        # will hold the majority element. This is guaranteed because the
        # majority element appears more than n/2 times, ensuring its net
        # count remains positive throughout the cancellation process.
        return candidate

```

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

1.  **Frequency Counting with Hash Maps:** For problems involving element frequencies or counts, hash maps (dictionaries) are often the first tool to consider. They offer O(1) average-case time complexity for insertions and lookups. Be mindful of total time if iterating through the input multiple times (like the provided solution's `nums.count`).
2.  **Leveraging Sorting for Positional Properties:** When an array has a specific property (like a majority element, median, or k-th smallest element), sorting can reveal these properties through element positions. While often O(N log N), it's a reliable general approach.
3.  **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:** This is a highly specialized and powerful algorithm for finding the majority element (an element appearing `> N/2` times) in O(N) time and O(1) space.
    *   **Core Idea:** It's a "cancellation" algorithm. Each non-majority element can cancel out at most one instance of the majority element. Since the majority element appears more than `N/2` times, it will always "outvote" and remain.
    *   **Applicability:** Look for problems where you need to find an element that has a disproportionately high frequency relative to others. Variations can exist for finding elements appearing `> N/k` times.
    *   **Verification Step:** In general Boyer-Moore, if the problem *doesn't* guarantee a majority element, a second pass is required to verify if the `candidate` truly has a count `> N/2`. However, for this specific problem, the guarantee simplifies it to a single pass.
4.  **"More than N/2" Property:** This is a strong property. It implies that the majority element can always be found at the `n/2` index after sorting. It also makes the Boyer-Moore algorithm trivially correct without a verification step.
5.  **Complexity Trade-offs:** Always consider time vs. space complexity. Hash maps offer O(N) time but use O(N) space. Boyer-Moore achieves O(1) space by being clever about how it counts. Sorting is often a good balance if O(N log N) is acceptable.

By understanding these approaches and their respective trade-offs, you can effectively tackle similar problems involving finding elements with specific frequency criteria.
