### 1. Problem Summary

You are given an array `events`, where each `events[i] = [startDay_i, endDay_i, value_i]` represents an event with a start day, end day, and an associated value. You are also given an integer `k`, which is the maximum number of events you can attend.

The rules for attending events are:
*   You can only attend one event at a time.
*   If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire duration.
*   The `endDay` is inclusive. You cannot attend two events where one ends and the other starts on the same day. This means if event A ends on `endDay_A`, and event B starts on `startDay_B`, then `startDay_B` must be strictly greater than `endDay_A` (i.e., `startDay_B >= endDay_A + 1`).

The goal is to find the maximum total `value` you can receive by attending at most `k` events while adhering to the non-overlapping rule.

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= k <= events.length`
*   `1 <= k * events.length <= 10^6` (This constraint suggests that solutions with complexity around `O(N*K*logN)` or `O(N*K)` would pass, where `N` is `events.length`).
*   `1 <= startDay_i <= endDay_i <= 10^9`
*   `1 <= value_i <= 10^6`

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

This problem exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it a classic candidate for Dynamic Programming.

#### 2.1 Naive Approach (Brute Force / Pure Recursion)

**Concept:**
The most straightforward approach is to explore all possible combinations of events. For each event, we have two choices:
1.  **Attend the current event:** If we choose to attend it, we add its value to our total and then recursively try to pick the next non-overlapping event from the remaining events, decrementing our `k` count.
2.  **Skip the current event:** We move to the next event in the list without attending the current one, keeping `k` unchanged.

We take the maximum value from these two choices.

**Process:**
1.  Define a recursive function `solve(current_event_idx, events_attended_count)`.
2.  Base cases:
    *   If `events_attended_count == k` or `current_event_idx == total_events`, return 0 (no more events can be attended or no more events to consider).
3.  Recursive step:
    *   Calculate `skip_value = solve(current_event_idx + 1, events_attended_count)`.
    *   To calculate `attend_value`:
        *   Find the next valid event `j` such that `events[j][0] > events[current_event_idx][1]` (i.e., `startDay_j >= endDay_current_event + 1`). This search would involve iterating through `events[current_event_idx + 1:]`.
        *   `attend_value = events[current_event_idx][2] + solve(j, events_attended_count + 1)`.
    *   Return `max(skip_value, attend_value)`.

**Drawbacks:**
*   **Overlapping Subproblems:** The same subproblems (e.g., `solve(event_X, count_Y)`) will be computed multiple times, leading to redundant calculations.
*   **Inefficient Next Event Search:** Linearly scanning for the next non-overlapping event for each choice can be very slow.
*   **Exponential Time Complexity:** Without memoization, this approach would have an exponential time complexity, similar to `O(2^N)` in the worst case (if all events are non-overlapping, leading to many choices).

#### 2.2 Optimized Approach: Dynamic Programming with Memoization (Top-Down)

This is the approach implemented in the provided solution.

**Key Observations for Optimization:**
1.  **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution for `dp(i, count)` can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems `dp(i+1, count)` and `dp(next_valid_event_index, count-1)`.
2.  **Overlapping Subproblems:** As noted in the naive approach, the same `(event_idx, count)` states will be revisited.
3.  **Sorting:** If we sort the events by their `startDay`, finding the *next non-overlapping event* becomes much more efficient using binary search.

**DP State Definition:**
Let `dp(i, count)` represent the maximum value one can obtain by considering events from index `i` onwards, with `count` events remaining to be attended.

**Pre-processing:**
Sort `events` by their `startDay` (and then by `endDay` or `value` for tie-breaking, though `startDay` is the primary key here, and other tie-breakers don't strictly matter for correctness, only for `bisect_right` behavior on identical start days, which is fine here as we're comparing `startDay_j > current_event_end_day`).

**Recursive Relation (with Memoization):**
`dp(i, count)`:
*   **Base Cases:**
    *   If `count == 0` (no more events can be attended) or `i == n` (all events have been considered), return 0.
*   **Choices:**
    1.  **Skip the current event `events[i]`:** The maximum value is `dp(i + 1, count)`.
    2.  **Attend the current event `events[i]`:**
        *   Add `events[i][2]` (its value) to the total.
        *   We need to find the *first* event `events[next_idx]` such that `events[next_idx][0] > events[i][1]` (i.e., `startDay_next_idx >= endDay_current_event + 1`).
        *   This `next_idx` can be found efficiently using binary search (`bisect_right` in Python) on the sorted `events` array.
        *   The value from this choice is `events[i][2] + dp(next_idx, count - 1)`.
*   **Result:** `return max(skip_value, attend_value)`.

**Memoization:** Store the result of `dp(i, count)` in a table (e.g., using `functools.lru_cache` in Python) to avoid recomputing.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Logic Behind the Provided Solution

The provided Python solution implements the Dynamic Programming approach with memoization and binary search optimization.

```python
import bisect
import functools

class Solution:
    def maxValue(self, events: list[list[int]], k: int) -> int:
        # 1. Sort the events by their start day.
        # This is crucial for efficiently finding the next non-overlapping event
        # using binary search (bisect_right).
        events.sort()
        n = len(events)

        # 2. Define the DP function with memoization.
        # @functools.lru_cache(None) automatically caches the results of function calls.
        # The key for memoization will be the tuple of arguments (i, count).
        @functools.lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i: int, count: int) -> int:
            # Base Case 1: If no more events can be attended (k exhausted), or
            # Base Case 2: If we have processed all events (reached end of array),
            # return 0 as no more value can be gained.
            if count == 0 or i == n:
                return 0

            # Option 1: Skip the current event (events[i]).
            # We move to the next event (i + 1) without decrementing the event count.
            skip_current_event_value = dp(i + 1, count)

            # Option 2: Attend the current event (events[i]).
            # Get the value of the current event.
            current_event_value = events[i][2]
            # Get the end day of the current event.
            current_event_end_day = events[i][1]

            # Find the index of the next valid event using binary search.
            # We need an event that starts strictly after current_event_end_day.
            # bisect_right(a, x) returns an insertion point which comes after
            # (to the right of) any existing entries of x in a.
            # Since events are sorted by startDay, we search for the first event
            # whose startDay is > current_event_end_day.
            # The target tuple [current_event_end_day, float('inf'), float('inf')]
            # ensures that bisect_right finds the first event whose first element (startDay)
            # is strictly greater than current_event_end_day.
            # The 'lo=i + 1' ensures we only search in events *after* the current one.
            next_event_idx = bisect.bisect_right(events, [current_event_end_day, float('inf'), float('inf')], lo=i + 1)
            
            # The value from attending the current event is its value plus
            # the maximum value from the subsequent non-overlapping events,
            # with one less event count remaining.
            attend_current_event_value = current_event_value + dp(next_event_idx, count - 1)

            # Return the maximum value obtainable from either skipping or attending the current event.
            return max(skip_current_event_value, attend_current_event_value)

        # Start the DP process:
        # Begin by considering the first event (index 0) with 'k' events allowed.
        return dp(0, k)
```

**Explanation of Key Parts:**

1.  **`events.sort()`**:
    *   The `events` list is sorted in ascending order based on the `startDay` of each event. This is crucial for two reasons:
        *   It allows the DP function to process events in chronological order, simplifying the "next event" logic.
        *   More importantly, it enables the use of `bisect_right` to efficiently find the next non-overlapping event.

2.  **`@functools.lru_cache(None)`**:
    *   This is a decorator that automatically memoizes the results of the `dp` function calls. `None` implies no size limit for the cache.
    *   When `dp(i, count)` is called, the decorator first checks if `(i, count)` is already in its cache. If yes, it returns the cached result. If not, it executes the function, stores the result, and then returns it. This prevents redundant computations of overlapping subproblems.

3.  **`dp(i: int, count: int) -> int`**:
    *   This is the core recursive DP function.
    *   `i`: The index of the current event being considered in the sorted `events` list.
    *   `count`: The remaining number of events that can be attended.

4.  **Base Cases (`if count == 0 or i == n`)**:
    *   If `count == 0`: We have used up all `k` allowed events. No more events can be attended, so we return 0 additional value.
    *   If `i == n`: We have considered all events in the `events` list (index `n` is out of bounds). No more events to choose from, so we return 0 additional value.

5.  **`skip_current_event_value = dp(i + 1, count)`**:
    *   This represents the scenario where we *do not* attend `events[i]`. We move to the next event `events[i+1]` and try to find the maximum value from there, still having `count` events left to pick.

6.  **`bisect.bisect_right(events, [current_event_end_day, float('inf'), float('inf')], lo=i + 1)`**:
    *   This is the clever part for efficiency.
    *   `bisect_right(a, x)`: Returns an insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of `x` in `a`. If all elements in `a` are less than or equal to `x`, it returns `len(a)`.
    *   `events` is sorted by `startDay`.
    *   The problem states: "you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day." This means `startDay_next > endDay_current`.
    *   The search target is `[current_event_end_day, float('inf'), float('inf')]`. When `bisect_right` compares tuples, it does so lexicographically. So, it first compares the `startDay` of an event with `current_event_end_day`.
        *   It finds the first index `j` such that `events[j][0] > current_event_end_day`.
        *   The `float('inf')` components are placeholders to ensure that even if `startDay` values are identical, the comparison eventually resolves (though `bisect_right` is typically fine with just the primary key if subsequent keys don't interfere with the ordering criteria).
    *   `lo=i + 1`: We only search for future events, starting from the one immediately after the current one.
    *   `next_event_idx` will be the index of the first event that starts *strictly after* the current event `events[i]` ends. If no such event exists, `next_event_idx` will be `n` (length of `events`), which correctly triggers the base case `i == n` in the recursive call.

7.  **`attend_current_event_value = current_event_value + dp(next_event_idx, count - 1)`**:
    *   This represents the scenario where we *do* attend `events[i]`.
    *   We add `events[i][2]` (its value) to our sum.
    *   Then, we recursively call `dp` from `next_event_idx` (the first valid non-overlapping event) and decrement `count` because we just attended one event.

8.  **`return max(skip_current_event_value, attend_current_event_value)`**:
    *   The function returns the maximum value obtained from either choosing to skip the current event or choosing to attend it.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Let `N` be the number of events and `K` be the maximum number of events that can be attended.

#### 4.1 Naive Approach (Pure Recursion without Memoization and linear search for next event)

*   **Time Complexity:** Exponential, roughly `O(2^N * N)`.
    *   Each event has two choices (attend/skip).
    *   Finding the next non-overlapping event can take `O(N)` time.
    *   In the worst case, if events are non-overlapping, the recursion tree can branch significantly.
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` for recursion stack depth.

#### 4.2 Optimized Approach (Dynamic Programming with Memoization and Binary Search)

*   **Pre-processing (Sorting):**
    *   `events.sort()`: `O(N log N)` time.
*   **DP Function (`dp`):**
    *   **Number of States:** The DP function `dp(i, count)` has `N` possible values for `i` (from 0 to `N-1`) and `K+1` possible values for `count` (from 0 to `K`). So, there are `O(N * K)` unique states.
    *   **Time per State:** For each state `(i, count)`, the `dp` function performs:
        *   A few constant-time operations.
        *   One recursive call for skipping (`dp(i + 1, count)`).
        *   One `bisect.bisect_right` call, which takes `O(log N)` time on a sorted list of `N` elements.
        *   One recursive call for attending (`dp(next_event_idx, count - 1)`).
    *   Since `lru_cache` ensures each state is computed only once, the total time for DP transitions is `O(N * K * log N)`.

*   **Total Time Complexity:** `O(N log N + N * K * log N)`. Since `N * K` can be up to `10^6` and `N` can be up to `10^6`, `N * K * log N` will dominate `N log N` if `K > 1`.
    *   Given constraints `1 <= k * events.length <= 10^6`, if `N=1000` and `K=1000`, `N*K = 10^6`. `log N` is about 10. So `10^6 * 10 = 10^7` operations, which is typically acceptable for a 1-second time limit.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `O(N * K)` for the memoization cache (to store the results of `N * K` states).
    *   `O(N)` for the recursion stack depth in the worst case (when `k` is small and `i` goes from `0` to `N-1`).
    *   **Total Space Complexity:** `O(N * K)`. This is typically the dominant space usage.
    *   Given `k * events.length <= 10^6`, `N*K` states mean `10^6` entries. If each entry is an integer, this is feasible (e.g., `10^6 * 4 bytes = 4 MB`).

---

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

*   **`k = 0`:** The base case `if count == 0` immediately handles this by returning `0`, as no events can be attended.
*   **`events` is empty (`n = 0`):** `events.sort()` handles an empty list. `dp(0, k)` will immediately hit the base case `i == n` (since `i=0` and `n=0`), returning `0`. Correct.
*   **`k >= N` (number of events available):** The problem states `1 <= k <= events.length`. So `k` is never strictly greater than `N`. If `k = N`, the solution correctly allows choosing up to `N` events. The `count` parameter naturally limits choices to `min(k, actual_events_chosen)`.
*   **All events overlap:** The `bisect_right` call will likely return `n` often, meaning no non-overlapping events can be found after attending one. The DP correctly evaluates `max` between attending (and getting value from one event) and skipping (which might lead to attending another single event later). In such cases, only one event can be chosen, and the algorithm will pick the one with the maximum value.
*   **No events overlap:** `bisect_right` will efficiently find the very next event `i+1` if it's the next chronologically sorted non-overlapping event. The algorithm will then consider all possible combinations of `k` non-overlapping events to maximize value.
*   **`startDay` and `endDay` values are very large (up to 10^9):** This does not affect the logic as the algorithm only cares about their relative order and differences, not their absolute magnitudes. `float('inf')` handles large numbers correctly in `bisect_right` comparisons.
*   **All events have value 1:** The logic remains the same, it will pick `k` events to maximize value (which will be `k` if `k` non-overlapping events are possible).
*   **All events have same `startDay` but different `endDay` / `value`:** The initial `events.sort()` ensures a consistent order. `bisect_right` correctly finds the point based on `startDay` comparison. Subsequent tie-breaking for `startDay` in `bisect_right` (using `float('inf')` for `endDay` and `value`) ensures it lands on the first event with `startDay > target_endDay`.

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

*   **Dynamic Programming for "Choose or Not Choose" Problems:** This is a classic pattern where for each item (event, in this case), you have two fundamental choices: to include it or to exclude it. When these choices lead to overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, DP is the way to go. The state `dp(index, count)` is very common for this type of problem.
*   **Sorting for Time-Based/Interval Problems:** When dealing with events or intervals, sorting them by start time (or end time) is often the first crucial step. It linearizes the problem space and enables efficient lookups for subsequent non-overlapping intervals.
*   **Binary Search (`bisect`) for "Next Valid Item":** After sorting, finding the next available item that satisfies a certain condition (e.g., starts after current event ends) can be done efficiently using binary search (`bisect_left` or `bisect_right` in Python). This optimizes an `O(N)` linear scan to `O(log N)`.
*   **Tuple Comparison with `bisect_right`:** When elements are tuples (like `[startDay, endDay, value]`), `bisect_right` performs lexicographical comparison. To find an element where only the first component matters for the "greater than" condition, padding with `float('inf')` for subsequent tuple components (e.g., `[target_value, float('inf'), float('inf')]`) is a common trick to ensure the comparison primarily relies on the first element. This correctly finds the first event whose `startDay` is strictly greater than `current_event_end_day`.
*   **Memoization (`functools.lru_cache`):** Python's `lru_cache` simplifies DP implementation, abstracting away the manual memoization table management. It's a powerful tool for quickly prototyping and solving recursive DP problems.
*   **Constraints as Hints:** The constraint `1 <= k * events.length <= 10^6` is a strong hint about the expected time complexity. It suggests that an `O(N*K)` or `O(N*K*log N)` solution is intended, validating the chosen DP approach with binary search.
