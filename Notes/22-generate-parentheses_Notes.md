## LeetCode 22: Generate Parentheses

### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to generate all unique combinations of *well-formed* parentheses given an integer `n`, representing `n` pairs of parentheses. A string of parentheses is considered "well-formed" if:

1.  Every opening parenthesis `(` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`.
2.  The parentheses are properly nested (e.g., `(())` is valid, `)(` is not).
3.  The total number of `(` must equal the total number of `)`.
4.  At any point while reading the string from left to right, the number of open parentheses encountered so far must be greater than or equal to the number of closed parentheses encountered so far.
5.  The total length of the string will be `2 * n`.

**Example:**
*   `n = 3` implies 3 pairs of parentheses. Output should be `["((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"]`.

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= n <= 8`: The small constraint `n <= 8` suggests that solutions with exponential time complexity (relative to `n`) might be acceptable, but efficient pruning is still important.

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

We'll categorize the approaches from naive brute-force to optimized recursive/dynamic programming solutions.

#### A. Naive Brute-Force Approaches

1.  **Generate All Possible Strings and Validate (Approach 7 from code)**
    *   **Idea:** Generate all possible strings of length `2n` consisting of `n` open parentheses and `n` closed parentheses. For each generated string, check if it's well-formed.
    *   **Mechanism:** One way to generate all strings of `(` and `)` is to iterate from `0` to `2^(2n) - 1`. Each number `k` can be represented in binary, where `1` represents `(` and `0` represents `)`.
    *   **Validation:** A string is well-formed if:
        *   The total count of `(` equals `n` (and thus `)` also equals `n`).
        *   A balance counter never goes below zero during traversal, and ends at zero.

2.  **Generate All Permutations and Validate (Approach 8 from code)**
    *   **Idea:** Create a base string with `n` open and `n` closed parentheses (e.g., for `n=3`, `((()))`). Then, generate all unique permutations of this string and validate each one.
    *   **Mechanism:** Use `itertools.permutations` (in Python) to get all permutations. Convert them to strings and use a set to store unique ones.
    *   **Validation:** Same balance check as above.

#### B. Recursive / Backtracking Approaches (DFS)

These approaches build the valid parenthesis strings step-by-step, making choices at each step and pruning invalid paths early.

1.  **Recursive Backtracking with `open_left` and `close_left` (Approach 1 from code)**
    *   **Idea:** Maintain counts of how many open and close parentheses are *still available* to be added.
    *   **State:** `(current_string, open_left, close_left)`
    *   **Rules:**
        *   If `open_left > 0`, we can add an `(`. Recurse with `open_left - 1`.
        *   If `close_left > open_left`, we can add a `)`. This is the crucial pruning step: we can only add a `)` if there's an `(` already placed that can be closed (i.e., we have more `(` *available to be matched* than `)` *we still need to place*). Recurse with `close_left - 1`.
    *   **Base Case:** When `open_left == 0` and `close_left == 0`, a valid string is formed.

2.  **Recursive Backtracking with `open_count` and `balance` (Approach 10 from code - Most Common Optimal)**
    *   **Idea:** Similar to the above, but track `open_count` (total open parens added so far) and `balance` (current open parens that are unmatched).
    *   **State:** `(current_string, open_count, balance)`
    *   **Rules:**
        *   If `open_count < n`, we can add an `(`. Increment `open_count`, increment `balance`.
        *   If `balance > 0`, we can add a `)`. This means there's an open parenthesis to close. Decrement `balance`.
    *   **Base Case:** When `len(current_string) == 2 * n` and `balance == 0`, a valid string is formed.

3.  **Recursive Backtracking with Generator (Approach 6 from code)**
    *   **Idea:** Same logic as Approach 1 or 10, but uses Python's `yield` keyword to return a generator, which can be more memory efficient as it doesn't build the entire result list at once until `list()` is called.

#### C. Iterative Approaches (BFS/DFS using Stack/Queue)

These approaches simulate the recursive backtracking using explicit data structures.

1.  **Iterative Backtracking (BFS using Queue) (Approach 4 from code)**
    *   **Idea:** Instead of recursion, use a queue to manage the states to explore. This performs a Breadth-First Search.
    *   **State stored in queue:** `(current_string, open_count, close_count)` (or `open_count, balance`).
    *   **Process:** Pop a state, apply the rules (add `(` or `)`), and push new states onto the queue.

2.  **Iterative Backtracking (DFS using Stack) (Approach 5 from code)**
    *   **Idea:** Similar to BFS, but uses a stack to manage states, performing a Depth-First Search iteratively.
    *   **State stored in stack:** `(current_string, open_count, close_count)`.
    *   **Process:** Pop a state, apply rules, push new states onto the stack. Note that for DFS to explore one path completely before backtracking, the order of pushing elements onto the stack for recursive calls matters (e.g., push `)` first, then `(` so `(` gets processed first).

#### D. Dynamic Programming Approaches

These approaches build solutions for `n` pairs by leveraging solutions for `k < n` pairs, avoiding redundant computations.

1.  **Iterative Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up) (Approach 2 from code)**
    *   **Idea:** A well-formed string of `i` pairs can be decomposed as `(A)B`, where `A` is a well-formed string of `j` pairs, and `B` is a well-formed string of `i - 1 - j` pairs.
    *   `dp[i]` will store all well-formed strings of `i` pairs.
    *   `dp[0] = [""]` (base case: 0 pairs is an empty string).
    *   For `i` from `1` to `n`:
        *   Iterate `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
        *   Take all `inner` strings from `dp[j]`.
        *   Take all `outer` strings from `dp[i - 1 - j]`.
        *   Form `(inner)outer` and add to `dp[i]`.

2.  **Recursive Dynamic Programming (with memoization) (Approach 3 from code, but needs explicit memoization)**
    *   **Idea:** Same recurrence relation as the iterative DP, but implemented recursively.
    *   Without memoization (e.g., `@functools.lru_cache` decorator in Python), this will recompute subproblems multiple times, leading to a much worse time complexity than the iterative DP. With memoization, its performance matches the iterative DP.

3.  **Inserting `()` into previous solutions (Approach 9 from code)**
    *   **Idea:** Generate solutions for `n-1` pairs. For each solution `s` from `n-1` pairs, insert `"()"` at every possible position within `s` (including beginning and end). Use a `set` to handle duplicates.
    *   **Example (n=2 from n=1):** `n=1` gives `["()"]`.
        *   Insert `()` into `"()"`:
            *   `"()" + "()"` -> `()()`
            *   `"(" + "()" + ")"` -> `(())`
            *   `"()" + "()"` -> `()()`
        *   Set removes duplicates: `["()()", "(())"]`.
    *   This approach is conceptually interesting but often less efficient than the standard DP or backtracking due to string manipulations and set operations.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Logic Behind Approaches

Let's focus on the most commonly used and efficient approaches: **Backtracking (DFS)** and **Dynamic Programming**.

#### 3.1. Optimal Backtracking / Recursive DFS (Based on Approach 10)

This is generally considered the most intuitive and efficient solution for competitive programming.

**Core Idea:**
We build a parenthesis string character by character. At each step, we have two choices: add an `(` or add a `)`. We only proceed if the choice leads to a potentially valid string.

**State Variables:**
*   `current_string`: The string built so far.
*   `open_count`: The number of `(` parentheses added so far in `current_string`.
*   `balance`: The current balance of open parentheses. This is `open_count - close_count`. It tracks how many open parentheses are still "unmatched".

**Rules for adding parentheses (Pruning):**

1.  **Adding `(`:**
    *   We can always add an `(` as long as we haven't used all `n` opening parentheses.
    *   Condition: `open_count < n`
    *   Action: `current_string + "(", open_count + 1, balance + 1`

2.  **Adding `)`:**
    *   We can only add a `)` if there is an unmatched `(` available to close. This means the `balance` must be greater than 0.
    *   Condition: `balance > 0`
    *   Action: `current_string + ")", open_count, balance - 1` (Note: `open_count` doesn't change as we are not adding an open parenthesis; `close_count` implicitly increases, decreasing `balance`).

**Base Case:**
*   A string is complete when its length reaches `2 * n` (since we need `n` pairs, total characters will be `2n`).
*   At this point, we must also ensure that `balance == 0`. This confirms all `(` have been matched by a `)`. If `balance` is not 0, it means we have unmatched `(` (if `balance > 0`) or `)` (if `balance < 0`, though our pruning rules should prevent negative balance).

**How it works:**
The function `backtrack(current_string, open_count, balance)` recursively explores all valid paths.
It starts with `("", 0, 0)`.
1.  Try adding `(` if `open_count < n`. This makes a recursive call.
2.  Upon returning from the `(` branch, try adding `)` if `balance > 0`. This makes another recursive call.
3.  When a base case is hit (`len(current_string) == 2*n` and `balance == 0`), the `current_string` is added to the `result` list.

This ensures that only well-formed parentheses strings are generated, as any path that violates the balance rule or exceeds the count of `n` open parentheses is naturally pruned.

#### 3.2. Dynamic Programming (Based on Approach 2)

**Core Idea (Catalan Number Property):**
The problem of generating well-formed parentheses is deeply connected to Catalan numbers. A well-formed string `S` of `n` pairs can always be uniquely decomposed as `(A)B`, where `A` is a well-formed string of `j` pairs, and `B` is a well-formed string of `n - 1 - j` pairs, for some `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

**Breakdown:**
Let `dp[i]` be the list of all well-formed parentheses strings with `i` pairs.

*   **`dp[0]`**: Represents 0 pairs. The only string is `""` (empty string).
    `dp[0] = [""]`

*   **`dp[1]`**: For 1 pair (`n=1`), we need to form `(A)B` where `A` has `j` pairs and `B` has `1 - 1 - j = 0 - j` pairs.
    *   Only `j=0` is possible.
    *   `A` has `0` pairs (`dp[0]`), so `A = ""`.
    *   `B` has `1 - 1 - 0 = 0` pairs (`dp[0]`), so `B = ""`.
    *   Result: `(A)B` becomes `("")("")` which is `()`
    `dp[1] = ["()"]`

*   **`dp[2]`**: For 2 pairs (`n=2`), we need to form `(A)B` where `A` has `j` pairs and `B` has `2 - 1 - j = 1 - j` pairs.
    *   **Case 1: `j=0`**
        *   `A` has `0` pairs (`dp[0]`), `A = ""`.
        *   `B` has `1 - 0 = 1` pair (`dp[1]`), `B = "()"`.
        *   Result: `("")("()")` which is `()()`
    *   **Case 2: `j=1`**
        *   `A` has `1` pair (`dp[1]`), `A = "()"`.
        *   `B` has `1 - 1 = 0` pairs (`dp[0]`), `B = ""`.
        *   Result: `("(")")"` which is `(())`
    `dp[2] = ["()()", "(())"]`

**Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize `dp = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`.
2.  Set `dp[0] = [""]`.
3.  For `i` from `1` to `n`:
    *   For `j` from `0` to `i - 1`:
        *   For each `inner_str` in `dp[j]`:
            *   For each `outer_str` in `dp[i - 1 - j]`:
                *   Add `(inner_str)outer_str` to `dp[i]`.
4.  Return `dp[n]`.

This iterative DP builds up the solutions efficiently by combining previously computed valid sub-problems.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

The number of well-formed parenthesis sequences of length `2n` (or `n` pairs) is given by the `n`-th Catalan number, `C_n = 1/(n+1) * binomial(2n, n)`.

For `n=8`, `C_8 = 1430`. The actual number of strings is quite small, but their generation can be complex.

#### A. Naive Brute-Force Approaches

1.  **Generate All Strings and Validate (Approach 7)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(2^(2n) * 2n)`
        *   `2^(2n)`: Number of possible strings of length `2n`.
        *   `2n`: Time to construct and validate each string.
        *   For `n=8`, this is `2^16 * 16 = 65536 * 16 = 1,048,576` operations, which is too slow if `n` were much larger, but perhaps acceptable for `n=8`.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(2n)` to store the `candidate` string.

2.  **Generate All Permutations and Validate (Approach 8)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O((2n)! / (n! * n!) * 2n)`
        *   `(2n)! / (n! * n!)`: This is `binomial(2n, n)`, which is `C_n * (n+1)`. This is the number of distinct permutations. `(2n)!` can be extremely large.
        *   `* 2n`: For validating each string.
        *   This is significantly worse than the `2^(2n)` approach because `(2n)!` grows much faster than `2^(2n)`. For `n=8`, `(16)! / (8! * 8!)` is about 12870, but generating *all* permutations before filtering is costly. `itertools.permutations` actually generates *all* permutations including duplicates, then the `set` conversion handles uniqueness. The number of raw permutations of `n` `(` and `n` `)` is `(2n)!`. This is prohibitively slow.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(2n)` per permutation + `O(C_n * 2n)` for the set of results.

#### B. Backtracking / Recursive DFS Approaches (Optimal in practice)

1.  **Approaches 1, 6, 10 (Recursive DFS)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(C_n * 2n)`
        *   `C_n`: The number of valid parenthesis strings (Catalan number).
        *   `* 2n`: In the worst case, each step of building a string involves string concatenation which takes `O(length)` time. Since the final string length is `2n`, and strings are built incrementally, string operations contribute to the overall cost. If strings were built with a list of characters and then joined at the end, string manipulation would be `O(2n)` for the final join.
        *   More precisely, the number of nodes in the recursion tree for valid paths is roughly proportional to `C_n`. Each node involves constant work and potentially string operations.
        *   For `n=8`, `C_8 * 16 = 1430 * 16 = 22,880` operations (approximately). This is very efficient for the given constraints.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
        *   This is the maximum depth of the recursion stack, which is `2n`. Each stack frame stores current string (max `2n` chars) and counts.

#### C. Iterative Approaches (BFS/DFS using Queue/Stack)

1.  **Approach 4 (BFS using Queue)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(C_n * 2n)` - Similar to DFS, as it explores the same state space.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(C_n * 2n)`
        *   In the worst case (at mid-level of the BFS traversal), the queue can hold a significant portion of the intermediate valid strings. The number of such strings can be `O(C_n)`. Each string is length `O(n)`. So, `O(C_n * n)`.

2.  **Approach 5 (Iterative DFS using Stack)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(C_n * 2n)` - Similar to recursive DFS.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` - Maximum depth of the stack is `2n`.

#### D. Dynamic Programming Approaches

1.  **Approach 2 (Iterative DP)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(C_n * n)`
        *   The outer loop runs `n` times. The middle loop runs `i` times. The inner loops iterate over `dp[j]` and `dp[i-1-j]`.
        *   The total number of strings generated is `C_n`. Each string concatenation for `(A)B` takes `O(n)` time.
        *   The sum `sum(C_j * C_{i-1-j})` for `j` from `0` to `i-1` equals `C_i`. So, for each `i`, we do `C_i` concatenations. The total time becomes `sum(C_i * i) for i=1 to n`. This is roughly `O(C_n * n)`.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(C_n * n)`
        *   The `dp` array stores all intermediate results. `dp[i]` stores `C_i` strings, each of length `2i`. Summing up memory for all `dp[0]` to `dp[n]` gives `O(C_n * n)`.

2.  **Approach 3 (Recursive DP without memoization)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(Catalan_number_recurrence * 2n)` which is exponential with high constant factor. Without memoization, many subproblems are recomputed, leading to severe inefficiency, much worse than `C_n`.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for recursion stack, but the repeated calculations make it practically unusable for larger `n`.

3.  **Approach 9 (Inserting `()` into previous solutions)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(C_n * n^2)`
        *   For each string of length `2(n-1)` from `C_{n-1}` previous solutions, we iterate `2n-1` times to insert `"()"`. Each string operation (slice + concatenation) takes `O(n)`.
        *   The `set` insertion also adds overhead, as it involves string hashing and comparisons.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(C_n * n)` for storing the set of results.

**Summary of Optimal Approaches:**

*   **Recursive Backtracking (DFS):** `O(C_n * n)` Time, `O(n)` Space. (Typically preferred for its elegance and stack space efficiency).
*   **Iterative Dynamic Programming:** `O(C_n * n)` Time, `O(C_n * n)` Space. (Can be faster due to no recursion overhead, but uses more memory).

Both are efficient enough for `n <= 8`.

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

*   **`n = 1`:**
    *   **Expected Output:** `["()"]`
    *   **Backtracking (Approach 10):**
        *   `backtrack("", 0, 0)`
        *   Add `(`: `backtrack("(", 1, 1)`
        *   `open_count` is now `n` (1). Cannot add more `(`.
        *   `balance` is `1` (`>0`), so add `)`: `backtrack("()", 1, 0)`
        *   Length is `2*n` (`2`), `balance` is `0`. Add `()` to `result`. Return.
        *   This path correctly yields `["()"]`.
    *   **Dynamic Programming (Approach 2):**
        *   `dp[0] = [""]`
        *   For `i=1`: `j=0`. `inner` from `dp[0]=""`, `outer` from `dp[0]=""`. `f"({inner}){outer}"` becomes `(""){""}` which is `()`. `dp[1] = ["()"]`.
        *   This path correctly yields `["()"]`.

*   **`n = 0` (Not strictly within constraints `1 <= n <= 8`, but good to consider for completeness):**
    *   **Expected Output:** `[""]` (an empty string, representing zero pairs)
    *   **Backtracking (Approach 10):** The `if len(current_string) == 2 * n` condition would become `len(current_string) == 0`. The initial call `backtrack("", 0, 0)` would immediately meet this condition. Since `balance` is `0`, `""` would be added to `result`. This works.
    *   **Dynamic Programming (Approach 2):** Explicitly handles `dp[0] = [""]`.

**General Handling:**
*   The pruning rules (`open_count < n`, `balance > 0`) ensure that we never generate invalid intermediate strings, thus preventing:
    *   Too many `(` or `)`
    *   Strings where `)` appears before its matching `(` (e.g., `)(`)
    *   Strings where the total count of `(` doesn't equal `n` or `)` doesn't equal `n` at the end.
*   The base case checks (`len(current_string) == 2 * n` and `balance == 0`) ensure that only complete and perfectly balanced strings are added to the result.

### 6. Clean, Well-Commented Version of the Optimal Solution

The most commonly adopted and efficient "optimal" solution is the recursive backtracking approach (similar to Approach 10). It's clean, intuitive, and performs well for the given constraints.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        # This approach uses recursive backtracking (Depth-First Search).
        # It systematically builds valid parenthesis strings.

        result = [] # This list will store all valid combinations

        # Helper function for backtracking
        # current_string: The string of parentheses built so far
        # open_count: The number of '(' parentheses added to current_string
        # balance: The current balance of open parentheses (open_count - close_count)
        #          A positive balance means there are unmatched open parentheses.
        def backtrack(current_string: str, open_count: int, balance: int):
            # Base Case: If the string length reaches 2 * n, it means we have placed all
            # n pairs of parentheses.
            if len(current_string) == 2 * n:
                # Check if the string is well-formed by ensuring the balance is 0.
                # A balance of 0 means all opened parentheses have been correctly closed.
                if balance == 0:
                    result.append(current_string) # Add the valid string to our results
                return # End this branch of recursion

            # Recursive Step 1: Try adding an opening parenthesis '('
            # We can add an opening parenthesis if we haven't used all 'n' allowed open parentheses.
            if open_count < n:
                # Recurse: Add '(' to current_string, increment open_count, increment balance.
                backtrack(current_string + "(", open_count + 1, balance + 1)

            # Recursive Step 2: Try adding a closing parenthesis ')'
            # We can add a closing parenthesis only if there is an unmatched opening parenthesis
            # to close. This is indicated by a positive 'balance'.
            # (i.e., we have more open parens than closed parens so far).
            if balance > 0:
                # Recurse: Add ')' to current_string, open_count remains same, decrement balance.
                backtrack(current_string + ")", open_count, balance - 1)

        # Start the backtracking process
        # Initial call: empty string, 0 open parentheses used, 0 balance.
        backtrack("", 0, 0)

        return result

```

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns that Can Be Applied to Similar Problems

1.  **Backtracking / DFS:**
    *   **Core Principle:** Used for systematically trying out different combinations/permutations to find all solutions. It involves building a solution step-by-step, and if a path proves to be invalid or leads to a non-solution, it "backtracks" (undoes the last choice) and tries another.
    *   **State Management:** Crucial to define what constitutes the "state" at each step of the recursion (e.g., `current_string`, `open_count`, `balance` here).
    *   **Decision Points:** Identify the choices available at each step (e.g., add `(` or `)`).
    *   **Pruning (Constraint Satisfaction):** The most important part for efficiency. Define conditions under which a path is definitively invalid and should be abandoned early. For parentheses, `balance < 0` or `open_count > n` are such conditions.
    *   **Base Case:** Define when a valid solution has been formed.

2.  **Parentheses Problems Pattern:**
    *   Many problems involving valid parentheses, brackets, or braces can be solved using a balance counter.
    *   Increment for opening symbols, decrement for closing symbols.
    *   Key rules:
        *   Balance should never drop below zero.
        *   Final balance must be zero.
        *   Total count of opening and closing symbols must be equal (or specific ratio).

3.  **Combinatorial Generation:**
    *   This problem is a classic example of generating all valid combinations. When you need "all combinations" or "all permutations" that satisfy certain rules, backtracking is a powerful technique.

4.  **Catalan Numbers:**
    *   Recognizing the connection to Catalan numbers (e.g., through the `(A)B` decomposition) can indicate that a Dynamic Programming approach might be viable. Problems involving balanced sequences, binary trees, polygon triangulations, etc., often relate to Catalan numbers. This provides insight into the expected number of solutions and thus the lower bound for an optimal algorithm's time complexity.

5.  **DFS vs. BFS for Combination Generation:**
    *   Both can solve the problem.
    *   **DFS (recursive or iterative with stack):** Explores one path to its end before exploring siblings. Typically uses less memory (recursion stack depth `O(N)`).
    *   **BFS (iterative with queue):** Explores level by level. Might use more memory as the queue can grow large (`O(C_n * N)`). Useful when you need the shortest path or level-by-level exploration.

6.  **String Building Optimization:**
    *   In Python, repeated string concatenation (`s += char`) can be inefficient for very long strings due to immutability (creating new string objects). For competitive programming, this is often fine for small `N`. For larger `N`, building a list of characters and then `"".join(char_list)` at the very end is more efficient. In this problem, `N` is small, so it's not a major concern.
