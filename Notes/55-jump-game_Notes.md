This document provides a comprehensive analysis of LeetCode problem 55: Jump Game.

---

### 1. Problem Summary

You are given an integer array `nums` where each element `nums[i]` represents your maximum jump length from index `i`. You start at the first index (`index 0`). The goal is to determine if you can reach the last index of the array.

**Example:**
*   `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]` -> `true` (Jump 1 step from 0 to 1, then 3 steps to reach index 4, which is the last index).
*   `nums = [3,2,1,0,4]` -> `false` (From index 3, you can only jump 0 steps, trapping you there, making it impossible to reach the last index).

---

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

#### 2.1. Naive / Brute Force (Recursion with Backtracking)

**Idea:** From the current index `i`, try all possible jump lengths from `1` up to `nums[i]`. For each possible jump, recursively call the function for the new position (`i + jump_length`). If any of these recursive calls returns `True` (meaning the last index is reachable from that new position), then the last index is reachable from the current position `i`.

**Logic:**
1.  Define a recursive function `can_reach(current_index)`.
2.  **Base Cases:**
    *   If `current_index` is the last index (`n - 1`), return `True`.
    *   If `current_index` goes beyond `n - 1`, return `False` (invalid jump).
3.  **Recursive Step:**
    *   For `jump_length` from `1` to `nums[current_index]`:
        *   Call `can_reach(current_index + jump_length)`.
        *   If it returns `True`, immediately return `True`.
4.  If the loop finishes without finding a path, return `False`.
5.  Start the process by calling `can_reach(0)`.

#### 2.2. Dynamic Programming (Top-Down with Memoization)

**Idea:** The brute force approach suffers from recomputing the reachability for the same indices multiple times. Memoization stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

**Logic:**
1.  Use a `memo` array (or dictionary) to store the result for each index: `memo[i]` will be `True` if the last index is reachable from `i`, `False` otherwise, and `None` (or a special value) if not yet computed.
2.  The recursive function `can_reach(current_index)` remains largely the same, but with added memoization:
    *   **Base Cases:** Same as brute force.
    *   **Memoization Check:** If `memo[current_index]` is already computed, return its value.
    *   **Recursive Step:** Same as brute force.
    *   **Store Result:** Before returning, store the computed result (`True` or `False`) in `memo[current_index]`.

#### 2.3. Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

**Idea:** Instead of starting from `index 0` and working towards the end, we can start from the end and work backwards.

**Logic:**
1.  Create a `dp` array of booleans, `dp[i]`, where `dp[i]` is `True` if `index i` is a "good" index (meaning the last index can be reached from `i`), and `False` if it's a "bad" index.
2.  Initialize `dp[n - 1] = True` (the last index is always a "good" index relative to itself).
3.  Iterate backwards from `index n - 2` down to `index 0`.
4.  For each `index i`:
    *   Calculate the maximum reachable index from `i`: `max_reach_from_i = min(n - 1, i + nums[i])`.
    *   From `next_pos` (which ranges from `i + 1` up to `max_reach_from_i`):
        *   If `dp[next_pos]` is `True` (meaning `next_pos` is a "good" index), then `index i` can reach a "good" index, so `dp[i]` becomes `True`. Break and move to the next `i`.
    *   If no such `next_pos` is found after checking all possible jumps from `i`, then `dp[i]` remains `False`.
5.  The final answer is `dp[0]`.

#### 2.4. Greedy Approach (Optimal Solution)

**Idea:** This is the most efficient approach. The core idea is to keep track of the maximum index that can be reached so far. If at any point the current index `i` becomes unreachable (i.e., `i` is greater than `farthest_reach`), then it's impossible to reach the end. Otherwise, continually update the `farthest_reach`.

**Logic:**
1.  Initialize `farthest_reach = 0` (starting at index 0, the farthest you can reach initially is 0).
2.  Iterate through the array using an index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.
3.  For each `i`:
    *   **Check Reachability:** If `i > farthest_reach`, it means the current `i` cannot be reached from any previous position that was reachable. Thus, it's impossible to reach the last index. Return `False`.
    *   **Update Farthest Reach:** Calculate the maximum index reachable from `i` (`i + nums[i]`). Update `farthest_reach` to be the maximum of its current value and this new possible reach: `farthest_reach = max(farthest_reach, i + nums[i])`.
    *   **Early Exit:** If `farthest_reach` becomes greater than or equal to `n - 1` (the last index), it means we have found a path to reach or surpass the end. Return `True`.
4.  If the loop completes, it implies that we successfully iterated through all indices up to `n - 1` without encountering an unreachable gap. This means `farthest_reach` must have been at least `n-1` by the time `i` reached `n-1`, making the last index reachable. Return `True`.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Logic (Provided Solution: Greedy)

The provided Python solution implements the **Greedy Approach**.

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        farthest_reach = 0 # This variable tracks the maximum index reachable from index 0 up to the current position.

        # We iterate through the array from the starting index (0) up to the last index (n-1).
        # The loop must continue as long as our current 'i' is within the 'farthest_reach' boundary.
        for i in range(n):
            # 1. Check if the current index 'i' is reachable:
            # If 'i' is greater than 'farthest_reach', it means we couldn't even reach this
            # current position 'i' from any of the previous positions.
            # This implies there's a gap that we cannot cross, making it impossible to reach the end.
            if i > farthest_reach:
                return False

            # 2. Update 'farthest_reach':
            # From the current position 'i', we can jump a maximum of 'nums[i]' steps.
            # So, 'i + nums[i]' is the new maximum index reachable from 'i'.
            # We update 'farthest_reach' to be the maximum of its current value
            # and this newly calculated reach. This ensures 'farthest_reach' always
            # holds the absolute furthest point we can get to by considering all
            # positions up to 'i'.
            farthest_reach = max(farthest_reach, i + nums[i])

            # 3. Early Exit Condition:
            # If 'farthest_reach' becomes greater than or equal to the index of the last element (n-1),
            # it means we have found a path that allows us to reach or even jump past the end.
            # In this case, we know it's possible to reach the last index, so we can return True immediately.
            if farthest_reach >= n - 1:
                return True
        
        # 4. Final Return:
        # If the loop completes without returning False (meaning we never hit an unreachable gap)
        # and also without returning True earlier (meaning 'farthest_reach' didn't explicitly
        # reach 'n-1' before 'i' reached 'n-1'), it implies that 'farthest_reach' was at least
        # 'n-1' by the time 'i' reached 'n-1'.
        # This covers cases like nums = [0] (n=1), where farthest_reach becomes 0, and 0 >= 1-1 (0) is true,
        # but the check happens for i=0. If not for the early return, it would reach here.
        # Essentially, if we've iterated through all reachable indices up to n-1 without
        # finding an uncrossable gap, it means we can reach the end.
        return True

```

**Why this greedy approach works:**

At each step `i`, we are trying to extend our current "reach" as much as possible. By calculating `farthest_reach = max(farthest_reach, i + nums[i])`, we ensure that `farthest_reach` always represents the absolute maximum index we can reach *given all positions we've considered up to `i`*.

If at any point `i` becomes greater than `farthest_reach`, it implies that all previous jumps from `0` up to `farthest_reach` were insufficient to bridge the gap to `i`. Since we always aim for the maximum possible jump, if even that couldn't get us to `i`, then no other sequence of jumps from previous points would have. Hence, the last index is unreachable.

Conversely, if we manage to iterate through the entire array without `i` exceeding `farthest_reach`, it means we could always reach the current index, and consequently, we must have been able to reach `n-1`. The `if farthest_reach >= n - 1` early exit handles the most common success cases efficiently. The final `return True` handles the edge case where the loop completes and `n-1` was exactly `farthest_reach` when `i` became `n-1` (or `n=1`).

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Naive/Brute Force (Recursion)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(2^N) in the worst case. Each position can lead to multiple recursive calls, resembling a decision tree.
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(N) due to the recursion call stack depth.

*   **Dynamic Programming (Top-Down with Memoization)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N * MaxJumpLength), where `MaxJumpLength` is the maximum value in `nums`. In the worst case, `nums[i]` could be close to `N`, making it O(N^2). Each state `i` is computed once, but computing it can involve a loop up to `nums[i]` times.
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(N) for the memoization table and O(N) for the recursion stack. Total O(N).

*   **Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N * MaxJumpLength). Similar to Top-Down, the outer loop runs `N` times, and the inner loop (checking reachable `j`) can run up to `N` times in the worst case. So, O(N^2).
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(N) for the `dp` array.

*   **Greedy Approach (Provided Solution)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** O(N). We iterate through the array once. Each operation inside the loop (`max`, comparison, addition) takes constant time.
    *   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We only use a few constant extra variables (`n`, `farthest_reach`, `i`).

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

*   **`nums.length == 1` (e.g., `nums = [0]` or `nums = [5]`):**
    *   `n = 1`. The loop `for i in range(n)` runs for `i = 0`.
    *   `farthest_reach` starts at `0`.
    *   `i=0`, `farthest_reach=0`. `0 > 0` is `False`.
    *   `farthest_reach = max(0, 0 + nums[0])`. If `nums[0]=0`, `farthest_reach` remains `0`. If `nums[0]=5`, `farthest_reach` becomes `5`.
    *   `if farthest_reach >= n - 1`: `if farthest_reach >= 0`. This condition will always be `True` since `farthest_reach` is initialized to `0` and only increases.
    *   The function returns `True`. This is correct, as you are already at the last index.

*   **Array with zero jumps (`nums[i] = 0`):**
    *   **Example: `nums = [3,2,1,0,4]`** (from problem statement)
        *   `n=5`, `farthest_reach=0`.
        *   `i=0`: `farthest_reach = max(0, 0+3) = 3`. `3 < 4`.
        *   `i=1`: `farthest_reach = max(3, 1+2) = 3`. `3 < 4`.
        *   `i=2`: `farthest_reach = max(3, 2+1) = 3`. `3 < 4`.
        *   `i=3`: `farthest_reach = max(3, 3+0) = 3`. `3 < 4`.
        *   `i=4`: `4 > farthest_reach (3)`. The condition `if i > farthest_reach` is met. Returns `False`.
    *   This is correctly handled by the `if i > farthest_reach: return False` check. If a zero jump traps you, eventually your current index `i` will surpass the `farthest_reach` you could achieve.

*   **Reaching the last index exactly (e.g., `nums = [2,3,1,1,0]`):**
    *   `n=5`, `farthest_reach=0`.
    *   `i=0`: `farthest_reach = max(0, 0+2) = 2`. `2 < 4`.
    *   `i=1`: `farthest_reach = max(2, 1+3) = 4`.
    *   `if farthest_reach >= n - 1`: `if 4 >= 4` is `True`. Returns `True`.
    *   The early exit condition `if farthest_reach >= n - 1: return True` handles this efficiently.

*   **All elements allow reaching far beyond the end (e.g., `nums = [5,4,3,2,1]`):**
    *   `n=5`, `farthest_reach=0`.
    *   `i=0`: `farthest_reach = max(0, 0+5) = 5`.
    *   `if farthest_reach >= n - 1`: `if 5 >= 4` is `True`. Returns `True`.
    *   The problem is quickly solved with the early exit.

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

*   **Greedy for Reachability:** This problem is a classic example where a greedy approach provides the most efficient solution. When dealing with problems that involve reaching a target or covering a range, and each step offers a maximum "reach" or "length", a greedy strategy of always maximizing your current reach (or minimizing current cost) is often optimal.
*   **"Maximum Reach" Thinking:** The core idea is to maintain the maximum boundary that can be reached from the starting point. If your current position exceeds this boundary, it implies failure. Otherwise, you continue to extend this boundary.
*   **Early Exit Conditions:** In greedy algorithms, frequently check if the goal has been achieved. Returning early (`if farthest_reach >= n - 1: return True`) improves performance by avoiding unnecessary iterations.
*   **Relationship to Interval Problems:** The `farthest_reach` logic is similar to merging or covering intervals. Each `nums[i]` effectively defines an interval `[i, i + nums[i]]` that you can reach from `i`. The problem asks if you can "chain" these intervals to cover the range `[0, n-1]`.
*   **Applicability to Similar Problems:**
    *   **Jump Game II (Minimum Jumps to Reach End):** While this problem asks for reachability, Jump Game II asks for the *minimum number of jumps*. A slightly more complex greedy approach (tracking current jump boundary and next jump boundary) can also solve this efficiently.
    *   **Maximum Number of K-sum Pairs / Similar Problems:** While not directly jump-related, the greedy principle of making the locally optimal choice to guarantee a globally optimal solution is a recurring theme in various algorithm problems.
