## LeetCode 2456: Construct Smallest Number From DI String

### 1. Problem Summary

**Problem Statement:**
Given a 0-indexed string `pattern` of length `n`, consisting only of characters `'I'` (increasing) and `'D'` (decreasing). We need to construct a 0-indexed string `num` of length `n + 1` that satisfies the following conditions:
1. `num` must consist of digits '1' through '9'.
2. Each digit from '1' to '9' can be used at most once.
3. If `pattern[i] == 'I'`, then `num[i] < num[i + 1]`.
4. If `pattern[i] == 'D'`, then `num[i] > num[i + 1]`.

The goal is to return the **lexicographically smallest** possible string `num` that meets all these conditions.

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= pattern.length <= 8`
* `pattern` consists of only 'I' and 'D' characters.

**Example 1: Input: "IIIDIDDD", Output: "123549876"**
**Example 2: Input: "DDD", Output: "4321"**

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

Given the constraint `pattern.length <= 8`, which implies `num` length is at most 9, the total number of digits required is small.

#### Approach 1: Brute Force (Permutations and Check)

*   **Idea:** Generate all possible permutations of `n+1` unique digits chosen from '1' through '9'. For each permutation, check if it satisfies the given `pattern` conditions. Keep track of the lexicographically smallest valid `num` found.
*   **Details:**
    1.  Determine `num_length = pattern.length + 1`.
    2.  Create a list of available digits: `'1', '2', ..., '9'`.
    3.  Generate all permutations of `num_length` digits selected from the available digits.
    4.  For each generated permutation `current_num_str`:
        *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `pattern.length - 1`.
        *   Check if `pattern[i] == 'I'` and `current_num_str[i] < current_num_str[i+1]` holds, OR
        *   Check if `pattern[i] == 'D'` and `current_num_str[i] > current_num_str[i+1]` holds.
        *   If any condition is violated, this permutation is invalid; move to the next.
        *   If all conditions are met, this is a valid `num`. Compare it lexicographically with the smallest valid `num` found so far and update if `current_num_str` is smaller.
*   **Feasibility:**
    *   The number of permutations of `k` digits chosen from 9 is `P(9, k) = 9! / (9-k)!`. For `k=9` (when `pattern.length=8`), it's `9! = 362,880`.
    *   Checking each permutation takes `O(N)` time.
    *   Total time complexity: `O(P(9, N+1) * N)`. For `N=8`, this is `O(9! * 8)`, which is approximately `2.9 * 10^6` operations. This might pass within typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second).
*   **Drawbacks:** While feasible for `N <= 8`, this approach is generally inefficient and would be too slow for larger `N`. It doesn't leverage the "lexicographically smallest" requirement efficiently until the final comparison.

#### Approach 2: Backtracking / Depth-First Search (DFS)

*   **Idea:** Construct the `num` string digit by digit using recursion. At each step, try placing an unused digit. Prune branches early if a condition is violated. To find the lexicographically smallest, always try smaller digits ('1' before '2', etc.) first for the current position.
*   **Details:**
    1.  Initialize `num_str` (empty), `used_digits` (e.g., a boolean array of size 10).
    2.  Define a recursive function `dfs(index, current_num_str, used_digits)`:
        *   **Base Case:** If `index == pattern.length + 1`, a valid `num` has been formed. Return `current_num_str`.
        *   **Recursive Step:** Iterate through digits `d` from '1' to '9'.
            *   If `d` is not `used_digits[d - '0']`:
                *   **Pruning:** If `index > 0`, check if placing `d` at `num[index]` satisfies `pattern[index-1]`:
                    *   If `pattern[index-1] == 'I'` and `current_num_str[index-1] >= d`, `d` is invalid.
                    *   If `pattern[index-1] == 'D'` and `current_num_str[index-1] <= d`, `d` is invalid.
                *   If `d` is valid:
                    *   Mark `d` as used (`used_digits[d - '0'] = true`).
                    *   Recursively call `dfs(index + 1, current_num_str + d, used_digits)`.
                    *   If the recursive call returns a valid result, propagate it upwards (as we try digits in increasing order, the first valid result found will be the lexicographically smallest).
                    *   Unmark `d` as used (`used_digits[d - '0'] = false`) for backtracking.
*   **Feasibility:** More efficient than brute-force permutations due to early pruning. The search space is still exponential but much smaller than `9!`. For `N=8`, `9^9` is too large, but pruning significantly reduces explored paths.
*   **Drawbacks:** Still potentially explores many paths compared to a highly specialized greedy solution.

#### Approach 3: Greedy with Stack (Optimal - Provided Solution's Logic)

*   **Idea:** This approach leverages the "lexicographically smallest" requirement by strategically assigning digits. It processes the pattern from left to right, always trying to use the smallest available digits. A stack is used to manage sequences of `'D'` (decreasing) characters, as these require digits to be assigned in reverse (decreasing) order.
*   **Crucial Insight:**
    *   To get the lexicographically smallest `num`, we want to use '1', then '2', etc., as early as possible.
    *   When we encounter an `'I'` (increasing) character or reach the end of the `pattern`, it signifies a point where accumulated numbers can be "committed" to the `result` string.
    *   For a sequence of 'D's like `...D D D I...`, the numbers `num[i] > num[i+1] > num[i+2]` must hold. To make `num[i]` as small as possible, while also allowing it to be greater than `num[i+1]` and so on, we use the smallest *block* of consecutive unused numbers (e.g., 5, 4, 3) and assign them in decreasing order (5 to `num[i]`, 4 to `num[i+1]`, 3 to `num[i+2]`). A stack naturally helps achieve this: push `3, 4, 5` onto the stack, then pop `5, 4, 3`.
*   **Detailed Step-by-Step (refer to provided solution):**
    1.  Initialize an empty `result` string and an empty `std::stack<int> stk`.
    2.  Loop `i` from `0` to `pattern.size()` (inclusive). This loop runs `n+1` times, ensuring `n+1` digits are considered. The value `i+1` represents the "next smallest available digit" if we were to simply count up from 1.
    3.  Inside the loop, for each `i`:
        *   `stk.push(i + 1);`: Push the current candidate digit onto the stack. These are digits `1, 2, ..., n+1`.
        *   `if (i == pattern.size() || pattern[i] == 'I')`: This is the decision point.
            *   If `pattern[i] == 'I'`: It indicates `num[i] < num[i+1]`. This means any preceding sequence of 'D's (which currently have their potential digits stored in `stk`) must now be assigned, and the current position `i` takes a smaller number than the next.
            *   If `i == pattern.size()`: This handles the last digit(s) of `num`. All remaining numbers in the stack must be appended.
            *   In both cases (`'I'` or end), pop all elements from the stack and append them to `result`.
            *   **Why this works for 'D's:** If the stack contains `[A, B, C]` (A at bottom, C at top), where `A < B < C` (because they were pushed as `i+1` sequentially), popping them yields `C, B, A`. This sequence `C, B, A` is a *decreasing* sequence. If this sequence corresponds to `num[k], num[k+1], num[k+2]`, then `num[k]=C`, `num[k+1]=B`, `num[k+2]=A`, satisfying `num[k] > num[k+1] > num[k+2]`. By always using `i+1` as the sequence of available numbers, we ensure the *smallest possible block* of numbers is used for these decreasing segments.
            *   **Why this works for 'I's:** If `pattern[i] == 'I'`, the current `i+1` is pushed and immediately popped (along with any preceding elements for a D-sequence). This assigns `i+1` (or the last of the `D` block) to `num[i]`. The next number will be `i+2` (or the start of a new `D` block), which will be greater, satisfying the `num[i] < num[i+1]` condition.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Logic Behind the Provided Solution

The provided solution cleverly combines a greedy strategy with a stack to construct the lexicographically smallest number.

1.  **Iterating for `n+1` digits:** The loop `for (int i = 0; i <= pattern.size(); i++)` runs `pattern.size() + 1` times. This is because the output string `num` has `n+1` digits (`num[0]` to `num[n]`), while `pattern` has `n` characters (`pattern[0]` to `pattern[n-1]`). Each `i` effectively corresponds to the character `pattern[i]` or the conceptual point after `num[i]`. The numbers `1, 2, ..., n+1` are used as the digits for `num`.

2.  **`stk.push(i + 1);`**: In each iteration, `i+1` (which sequentially generates `1, 2, 3, ...` up to `n+1`) is pushed onto the stack. These are the smallest available unique digits we can use. The stack effectively collects candidate digits.

3.  **`if (i == pattern.size() || pattern[i] == 'I')`**: This condition determines when to "commit" the digits currently in the stack to the `result` string.
    *   **`pattern[i] == 'I'`**: An 'I' indicates an "increasing" relationship, meaning `num[i] < num[i+1]`. This acts as a boundary or a "flush" point. Any numbers currently accumulated in the stack must correspond to a sequence of `D`'s *ending* just before this 'I', or just a single `I`. When an 'I' is encountered, it's time to resolve the pending numbers.
    *   **`i == pattern.size()`**: This is the loop's final iteration. It means we've processed all `n` characters of the `pattern`, and any remaining digits in the stack must be appended to form the last part of `num`.

4.  **`while (!stk.empty()) { result += to_string(stk.top()); stk.pop(); }`**: When the "commit" condition is met, all elements are popped from the stack and appended to the `result` string.
    *   **Why reverse order (stack's LIFO)?** Consider `pattern = "DDD"`.
        *   `i=0`: push 1. `stk: [1]`
        *   `i=1`: push 2. `stk: [1, 2]`
        *   `i=2`: push 3. `stk: [1, 2, 3]`
        *   `i=3` (end of pattern): push 4. `stk: [1, 2, 3, 4]`. Now `i == pattern.size()` is true.
        *   Pop from stack: 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. `result = "4321"`. This satisfies `num[0]>num[1]>num[2]>num[3]`. The stack reversed the sequence `1,2,3,4` to `4,3,2,1`, which is perfect for `D` constraints.
    *   **Why this is greedy and optimal?** By always pushing `i+1` (the smallest available next digit) and only committing these digits when an 'I' or end is hit, the algorithm ensures that for any `D` sequence, the *smallest possible block of consecutive numbers* (e.g., `4,3,2,1` instead of `9,8,7,6`) is used. Furthermore, these numbers are correctly arranged in decreasing order by the stack. For `I` sequences, the smallest available digit is used, ensuring the lexicographically smallest property.

**Conceptual Example Trace: `pattern = "IIIDIDDD"`**

| `i` | `pattern[i]` | `stk.push(i+1)` | Stack State (top) | Condition `i == n || pattern[i] == 'I'` | Action (pop) | `result` String | `num` digits filled (conceptual) |
| :-- | :----------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| 0   | 'I'          | `stk.push(1)`   | `[1]`             | `pattern[0] == 'I'`                      | Pop 1        | "1"             | `num[0] = 1`                        |

| 5   | 'D'          | `stk.push(6)`   | `[6]`             | `pattern[5] != 'I'`                      | None         | "12354"         | (storing for `D` sequence)        |
| 6   | 'D'          | `stk.push(7)`   | `[6, 7]`          | `pattern[6] != 'I'`                      | None         | "12354"         | (storing for `D` sequence)        |
| 7   | 'D'          | `stk.push(8)`   | `[6, 7, 8]`       | `pattern[7] != 'I'`                      | None         | "12354"         | (storing for `D` sequence)        |
| 8   | (End)        | `stk.push(9)`   | `[6, 7, 8, 9]`    | `i == pattern.size()`                    | Pop 9,8,7,6  | "123549876"     | `num[5]=9, num[6]=8, num[7]=7, num[8]=6` (`num[5]>num[6]>num[7]>num[8]`) |

Final `result`: "123549876", which matches the example output.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

*   **Approach 1: Brute Force (Permutations and Check)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(P(9, N+1) * N)`, where `P(9, N+1)` is the number of permutations of `N+1` digits chosen from 9, and `N` is `pattern.length`. In the worst case (`N=8`), this is `O(9! * 8)`, approximately `2.9 * 10^6` operations.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` to store the current permutation and the result string.

*   **Approach 2: Backtracking / DFS**
    *   **Time Complexity:** Exponential, but significantly reduced by pruning. The worst-case upper bound is difficult to state precisely but is better than brute force `9!`. Roughly `O(N * C^N)` where `C` is a constant less than 9.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` for the recursion stack depth and the `used_digits` boolean array.

*   **Approach 3: Greedy with Stack (Provided Solution - Optimal)**
    *   **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is `pattern.length`. The loop runs `N+1` times. Each digit (`1` to `N+1`) is pushed onto the stack exactly once and popped exactly once over the entire execution. Stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `empty`, `top`) are `O(1)`. String concatenation `result += ...` is amortized `O(1)` in C++ `std::string` for appending characters. Therefore, the total time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the pattern.
    *   **Space Complexity:** `O(N)`. The stack `stk` can hold up to `N+1` elements in the worst case (e.g., if the pattern is all 'D's). The `result` string also grows to length `N+1`.

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

The provided solution correctly handles various edge cases due to its robust logic:

*   **Smallest `pattern.length` (N=1):**
    *   `pattern = "I"`: `result` will be "12".
        *   `i=0`: push 1. `pattern[0]=='I'`, pop 1. `result="1"`.
        *   `i=1` (end): push 2. `i==pattern.size()`, pop 2. `result="12"`. Correct.
    *   `pattern = "D"`: `result` will be "21".
        *   `i=0`: push 1.
        *   `i=1` (end): push 2. `i==pattern.size()`, pop 2, then 1. `result="21"`. Correct.
    The loop runs `N+1` times, ensuring all necessary digits (`1` to `N+1`) are considered and processed.

*   **Pattern with all 'I's:** E.g., `pattern = "IIII"` (`N=4`). `num` length 5.
    *   The loop pushes `1` then immediately pops `1`. Then pushes `2` then immediately pops `2`, and so on.
    *   This results in `result = "12345"`. Correct.

*   **Pattern with all 'D's:** E.g., `pattern = "DDD"` (`N=3`). `num` length 4.
    *   The loop pushes `1`, then `2`, then `3`, then `4` (at `i=3`, end of pattern).
    *   Only at `i=3` (when `i == pattern.size()`) does the `while` loop activate, popping `4, 3, 2, 1`.
    *   This results in `result = "4321"`. Correct.

*   **Constraints on Digits:** The problem states digits '1' through '9' are used at most once. Since `pattern.length <= 8`, `num` length `N+1` is at most `9`. This perfectly aligns with using digits '1' through '9'. The algorithm always uses the numbers `1` through `N+1` exactly once, which are guaranteed to be unique and within the '1' to '9' range.

### 6. Clean, Well-Commented Version of the Optimal Solution

```cpp
#include <string>   // Required for std::string
#include <stack>    // Required for std::stack
#include <algorithm> // Not strictly necessary for this specific code, but good practice for to_string/other utilities

class Solution {
public:
    std::string smallestNumber(std::string pattern) {
        // 'result' will store the final lexicographically smallest number string.
        std::string result = "";
        
        // 'stk' (stack) is used to temporarily hold digits.
        // It plays a crucial role in reversing the order of numbers for 'D' (decreasing) patterns.
        std::stack<int> stk;

        // Iterate from 0 up to and including pattern.size().
        // This loop effectively runs pattern.size() + 1 times,
        // covering all N+1 digits that need to be placed in the 'num' string.
        // 'i' can be thought of as the current digit count or the index in pattern.
        for (int i = 0; i <= pattern.size(); i++) {
            // Push the next available smallest digit (starting from 1) onto the stack.
            // These digits (1, 2, ..., N+1) are candidates for the current segment
            // of the 'num' string being built.
            stk.push(i + 1);  
            
            // This 'if' condition is the core of the greedy strategy.
            // It triggers when:
            // 1. We have processed the entire pattern (i == pattern.size()):
            //    This means any remaining digits in the stack must be appended to 'result'.
            // 2. We encounter an 'I' character in the pattern (pattern[i] == 'I'):
            //    An 'I' signifies an increasing relationship (num[i] < num[i+1]).
            //    It acts as a boundary. Any sequence of 'D' (decreasing) characters
            //    that occurred just before this 'I' must now be resolved and their
            //    corresponding digits committed to 'result'.
            if (i == pattern.size() || pattern[i] == 'I') {
                // When the condition is met, pop all numbers currently in the stack.
                // Numbers were pushed onto the stack in increasing order (e.g., 4, 5, 6).
                // Popping them off results in a decreasing order (6, 5, 4).
                // This decreasing order is precisely what's needed to satisfy 'D' constraints
                // (e.g., num[idx] > num[idx+1] > num[idx+2]).
                // For 'I' constraints (where a single number is pushed and immediately popped),
                // it simply adds the next smallest available number, maintaining the increasing order.
                while (!stk.empty()) {
                    result += std::to_string(stk.top()); // Convert int to string and append
                    stk.pop();                           // Remove the digit from the stack
                }
            }
        }

        return result; // Return the constructed lexicographically smallest number string
    }
};

```

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

*   **Lexicographical Smallest Principle:** The fundamental rule for finding the lexicographically smallest string is to place the smallest possible digits at the earliest possible positions. This problem's solution adheres to this by always considering `i+1` (the smallest available digit for the current step) and deferring its placement.
*   **Stack for Reversal and Ordering:** A stack's Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) property is perfectly utilized here. When a sequence of numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3) is pushed onto the stack, popping them reverses their order (3, 2, 1). This is crucial for handling 'D' (decreasing) sequences, where we need to assign relatively larger numbers earlier in the sequence and smaller numbers later, while still using the smallest possible set of actual digits (e.g., 4,3,2,1 for "DDD" instead of 9,8,7,6).
*   **Delimiter-Driven Processing:** The 'I' character in the `pattern` (and the end of the string) acts as a natural delimiter. It signals the completion of a block of conditions (potentially a sequence of 'D's or a single 'I'). Upon encountering such a delimiter, the algorithm "commits" the digits accumulated for that block. This pattern is useful in problems where you process a stream of data and need to perform an action when a certain condition or boundary is met.
*   **Greedy Construction:** The solution is greedy because at each step, it makes the locally optimal choice: push the next smallest available number. The global optimality (lexicographically smallest) is achieved by intelligently deciding *when* to commit these numbers from the stack, specifically at 'I' boundaries or the end of the pattern, which ensures that 'D' sequences get numbers in the correct decreasing order while respecting the "smallest possible" principle.
*   **Pattern Recognition for `D` and `I` Blocks:** The problem can be viewed as identifying segments of 'D's and 'I's. The stack effectively groups numbers for `D` segments and then assigns them in decreasing order, while `I` segments generally cause immediate assignment of the next available number.
*   **Applicability to Similar Problems:** This approach is a good example of how a stack can be used to manage elements that need to be reordered or grouped based on a sequence of conditions. Similar ideas apply in problems like:
    *   Processing nested structures (e.g., valid parentheses, parsing expressions).
    *   Problems requiring finding "next greater/smaller element" or similar monotonic sequence properties.
    *   Constructing sequences with specific ordering constraints, especially when those constraints involve "increasing" or "decreasing" relationships.
