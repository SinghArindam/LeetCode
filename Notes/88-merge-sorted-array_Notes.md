## LeetCode 88: Merge Sorted Array

### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to merge two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, both of which are already sorted in non-decreasing order, into a single sorted array. The critical constraint is that the merge operation must be performed *in-place* within `nums1`.

`nums1` initially contains `m` sorted elements followed by `n` zeros. These `n` zeros are placeholders to ensure `nums1` has enough capacity (`m + n`) to hold all elements from both arrays after merging. `nums2` contains `n` sorted elements.

We are given:
*   `nums1`: An array of length `m + n`. The first `m` elements are the valid sorted numbers, and the last `n` elements are 0s to be ignored (they are just space).
*   `m`: The number of valid elements in `nums1`.
*   `nums2`: An array of length `n`.
*   `n`: The number of elements in `nums2`.

The function `merge` should modify `nums1` directly and not return anything.

**Examples:**
*   `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3`
    *   Merge `[1,2,3]` and `[2,5,6]`.
    *   Result in `nums1`: `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`
*   `nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0`
    *   Merge `[1]` and `[]`.
    *   Result in `nums1`: `[1]`
*   `nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1`
    *   Merge `[]` and `[1]`.
    *   Result in `nums1`: `[1]` (Note: `m=0` means `nums1` initially has no valid elements, only placeholders.)

**Constraints:**
*   `nums1.length == m + n`
*   `nums2.length == n`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 200`
*   `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

This problem can be approached with varying levels of efficiency, primarily differing in their time and space complexity.

#### Approach 1: Naive - Copy and Sort (Provided Solution)

This is the simplest approach to implement in Python. It leverages built-in list operations and sorting functionality.

**Logic:**
1.  Extract the `m` valid elements from `nums1`.
2.  Concatenate these `m` elements with all `n` elements from `nums2`.
3.  Assign this newly formed list back to `nums1` (using `nums1[:] = ...` to modify in-place).
4.  Sort the entire `nums1` array.

#### Approach 2: Using Extra Space for Merging (Conceptual)

This approach is a standard way to merge two sorted arrays if extra space is allowed, and it forms the basis for the merge step in merge sort. While not the most optimal for *this specific problem's* constraints (due to `O(m+n)` space), it's good to understand.

**Logic:**
1.  Create a new temporary array, `merged_array`, of size `m + n`.
2.  Use two pointers, `p1` for `nums1` (initially pointing to index 0) and `p2` for `nums2` (initially pointing to index 0).
3.  Iterate, comparing `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`. Copy the smaller element to `merged_array` and advance its respective pointer.
4.  After one array is exhausted, copy any remaining elements from the other array into `merged_array`.
5.  Finally, copy all elements from `merged_array` back into `nums1`.

#### Approach 3: Optimal - Two Pointers from the End (O(m+n) Time, O(1) Space)

This approach directly addresses the "in-place" requirement efficiently. The key insight is to merge elements from the *end* of `nums1` to the *beginning* of `nums1`'s storage space. This avoids overwriting elements in `nums1` that haven't been processed yet.

**Logic:**
1.  Initialize three pointers:
    *   `p1`: Points to the last valid element of `nums1` (`m - 1`).
    *   `p2`: Points to the last element of `nums2` (`n - 1`).
    *   `p`: Points to the last available position in `nums1` where a merged element should be placed (`m + n - 1`). This is where the merged result will be built from the end.
2.  While both `p1` and `p2` are non-negative (meaning there are still elements to compare in both arrays):
    *   Compare `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`.
    *   Place the larger of the two into `nums1[p]`.
    *   Decrement the pointer of the array from which the element was taken (`p1` or `p2`).
    *   Decrement `p` (as `nums1[p]` has now been filled).
3.  After the loop, one of the arrays (`nums1` or `nums2`) might still have remaining elements.
    *   If `nums2` still has elements (`p2 >= 0`), it means all remaining `nums2` elements are smaller than any remaining `nums1` elements (which would have already been placed). Copy these remaining `nums2` elements into `nums1` from `p` downwards.
    *   If `nums1` still has elements (`p1 >= 0`), no action is needed. These elements are already in their correct sorted positions relative to each other within the first `m` slots, and any `nums2` elements would have been placed *after* them if larger, or *before* them (filling early `nums1` slots) if smaller. Since we are filling from the end, if `nums1` elements remain, they are already correctly positioned in the lower indices.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Logic

#### 3.1. Provided Solution Logic (Approach 1: Copy and Sort)

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        # Step 1 & 2: Extract valid elements from nums1, concatenate with nums2.
        # nums1[0:m] creates a new list containing the first m elements of nums1.
        # This new list is then concatenated with nums2, creating another new list.
        # The slice assignment nums1[:] = ... replaces the *contents* of nums1
        # with the elements from this new concatenated list. This achieves the in-place
        # modification of the original nums1 list object.
        nums1[:] = nums1[0:m] + nums2
        
        # Step 3: Sort the entire modified nums1 array.
        # This sorts all (m+n) elements that are now in nums1.
        # The `if len(nums1) >= 1:` check is technically redundant for the problem
        # constraints as m+n >= 1 always, and sort() on an empty list is harmless.
        # It might be a defensive programming habit or specific language quirk.
        if len(nums1)>=1: # This check is not strictly necessary given constraints (m+n >= 1).
            nums1.sort()
```

**Why it works:**
This approach works because Python's list slicing and concatenation provide an easy way to combine the relevant parts of the arrays, and its `sort()` method is robust. The `nums1[:] = ...` syntax is crucial for modifying the list *in-place* as required, rather than just reassigning the `nums1` variable to a new list object.

**Alternative Perspective (Less Pythonic, but illustrative):**
One could manually copy `nums2` into the `n` placeholder zeros of `nums1` first, then sort:

```python
# Alternative for Approach 1 (more explicit manual copy)
# for i in range(n):
#     nums1[m + i] = nums2[i]
# nums1.sort()
```
This avoids the temporary list creation from slicing/concatenation, but still requires a sort, leading to similar time complexity.

#### 3.2. Optimal Solution Logic (Approach 3: Two Pointers from the End)

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        # Initialize pointers
        # p1 points to the last valid element in nums1
        p1 = m - 1
        # p2 points to the last element in nums2
        p2 = n - 1
        # p points to the last position in nums1 where we will place the merged element
        # This is (m + n - 1) because nums1 has a total length of m + n.
        p = m + n - 1

        # Iterate while there are elements to compare in both arrays
        while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:
            # Compare elements from the end of both valid sections
            if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
                # If nums1's current element is larger, place it at the current end of nums1
                nums1[p] = nums1[p1]
                p1 -= 1  # Move p1 to the next smaller element in nums1
            else:
                # If nums2's current element is larger or equal, place it at the current end of nums1
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
                p2 -= 1  # Move p2 to the next smaller element in nums2
            p -= 1 # Move p to the next available position in nums1 (towards the beginning)

        # After the main loop, one of the arrays might have remaining elements.
        # Since we are merging from the end, if nums1 still has elements (p1 >= 0),
        # they are already in their correct sorted positions relative to each other
        # (and potentially smaller than all nums2 elements processed so far, which
        # would have filled positions further to the right). So, no action needed for nums1.

        # If nums2 still has elements (p2 >= 0), it means these elements are smaller
        # than any remaining elements in nums1 (which would have been processed earlier
        # and moved to the right). We need to copy these remaining nums2 elements
        # into the beginning of nums1.
        while p2 >= 0:
            nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
            p2 -= 1
            p -= 1

```

**Why it works (Two Pointers from the End):**
The key challenge in merging in-place is avoiding overwriting elements that still need to be read. By starting from the end of `nums1` and `nums2` and filling `nums1` from its *end* (`m+n-1`) backwards, we ensure that:
1.  The largest elements are placed first in their correct final positions.
2.  When we place an element, the position it came from (either `p1` or `p2`) and the target position `p` are distinct from any elements that still need to be considered.
Specifically, `nums1[p1]` will *never* be overwritten by `nums1[p]` because `p` is always `>= p1`. If `nums1[p1]` is used, it's copied to `nums1[p]`, and `p1` moves left. If `nums2[p2]` is used, `nums1[p1]` remains untouched for a later comparison.
The remaining `nums2` elements copy step is crucial because `nums2` elements might be smaller than *all* `nums1` elements, meaning they would fill the very beginning of `nums1`. If `nums1` elements remain, they are already correctly positioned at the start of the array relative to each other, so no copying is needed.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

#### Approach 1: Naive - Copy and Sort (Provided Solution)

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   `nums1[0:m]`: Slicing takes `O(m)` time.
    *   `+ nums2`: Concatenating a list of size `m` with a list of size `n` takes `O(m + n)` time.
    *   `nums1.sort()`: Sorting a list of `m + n` elements takes `O((m + n) log (m + n))` time.
    *   **Total Time:** `O(m) + O(m + n) + O((m + n) log (m + n)) = O((m + n) log (m + n))`.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `nums1[0:m]`: Creates a new list of `m` elements. `O(m)` space.
    *   `nums1[0:m] + nums2`: Creates another new list of `m + n` elements during concatenation. `O(m + n)` space.
    *   The slice assignment `nums1[:] = ...` effectively replaces content in-place, but the *creation* of the temporary list before assignment requires space.
    *   Sorting in Python (`list.sort()`) is typically Timsort, which uses `O(N)` auxiliary space in the worst case (where N is `m+n`).
    *   **Total Space:** `O(m + n)` due to the temporary list created by concatenation and potentially by the sort algorithm.

#### Approach 2: Using Extra Space for Merging (Conceptual)

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Iterating through `nums1` and `nums2` to fill `merged_array`: `O(m + n)` (each element visited and compared once).
    *   Copying `merged_array` back to `nums1`: `O(m + n)`.
    *   **Total Time:** `O(m + n)`.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `merged_array`: Requires a new array of size `m + n`.
    *   **Total Space:** `O(m + n)`.

#### Approach 3: Optimal - Two Pointers from the End

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The `while` loop iterates `m + n` times in total (at most), because in each step, one of the pointers (`p1`, `p2`, or `p`) is decremented, and they start from `m-1`, `n-1`, and `m+n-1` respectively, going down to `-1`. Each element is considered and placed exactly once.
    *   **Total Time:** `O(m + n)`. This matches the follow-up question's requirement.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   All operations are performed in-place within `nums1`. Only a few constant-space pointers are used.
    *   **Total Space:** `O(1)`.

### 5. Edge Cases and Handling

Let's examine how the optimal (two-pointer) approach handles common edge cases:

1.  **`m = 0` (empty `nums1`'s initial part):**
    *   `nums1 = [0,0,0], m = 0, nums2 = [1,2,3], n = 3`
    *   `p1 = -1`, `p2 = 2`, `p = 2`
    *   The main `while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0` loop will *not* execute because `p1` is initially `-1`.
    *   The second `while p2 >= 0` loop will execute.
        *   `nums1[2] = nums2[2]` (3) -> `nums1 = [0,0,3]`, `p2=1, p=1`
        *   `nums1[1] = nums2[1]` (2) -> `nums1 = [0,2,3]`, `p2=0, p=0`
        *   `nums1[0] = nums2[0]` (1) -> `nums1 = [1,2,3]`, `p2=-1, p=-1`
    *   Correctly handles by just copying `nums2` into `nums1`.

2.  **`n = 0` (empty `nums2`):**
    *   `nums1 = [1,2,3], m = 3, nums2 = [], n = 0`
    *   `p1 = 2`, `p2 = -1`, `p = 2`
    *   The main `while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0` loop will *not* execute because `p2` is initially `-1`.
    *   The second `while p2 >= 0` loop will *not* execute.
    *   `nums1` remains `[1,2,3]`, which is already correct.
    *   Correctly handles by doing nothing, as `nums1` is already sorted.

3.  **One array fully merged before the other (during the main loop):**
    *   **`nums1` runs out first:** `nums1 = [4,5,6,0,0,0], m=3, nums2 = [1,2,3], n=3`
        *   `p1=2, p2=2, p=5`
        *   `nums1[2]=6, nums2[2]=3`. `nums1[5]=6, p1=1, p=4`
        *   `nums1[1]=5, nums2[2]=3`. `nums1[4]=5, p1=0, p=3`
        *   `nums1[0]=4, nums2[2]=3`. `nums1[3]=4, p1=-1, p=2`. `p1` is now `-1`, loop ends.
        *   `nums1` is now `[4,5,6,4,5,6]` (temp state)
        *   Remaining `nums2` elements (`p2=2`): `[1,2,3]`
        *   Second `while p2 >= 0` loop:
            *   `nums1[2] = nums2[2]` (3) -> `nums1 = [4,5,3,4,5,6]`, `p2=1, p=1`
            *   `nums1[1] = nums2[1]` (2) -> `nums1 = [4,2,3,4,5,6]`, `p2=0, p=0`
            *   `nums1[0] = nums2[0]` (1) -> `nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`, `p2=-1, p=-1`
        *   Final result: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`. Correct.
    *   **`nums2` runs out first:** `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m=3, nums2 = [4,5,6], n=3`
        *   `p1=2, p2=2, p=5`
        *   `nums1[2]=3, nums2[2]=6`. `nums1[5]=6, p2=1, p=4`
        *   `nums1[2]=3, nums2[1]=5`. `nums1[4]=5, p2=0, p=3`
        *   `nums1[2]=3, nums2[0]=4`. `nums1[3]=4, p2=-1, p=2`. `p2` is now `-1`, loop ends.
        *   `nums1` is now `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` (temp state)
        *   Remaining `nums1` elements (`p1=2`): `[1,2,3]`
        *   Second `while p2 >= 0` loop does *not* execute.
        *   Final result: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`. Correct.

4.  **All elements from `nums1` are smaller than all from `nums2`:** (Handled by previous example `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m=3, nums2 = [4,5,6], n=3`)
5.  **All elements from `nums2` are smaller than all from `nums1`:** (Handled by previous example `nums1 = [4,5,6,0,0,0], m=3, nums2 = [1,2,3], n=3`)
6.  **Single elements:**
    *   `nums1 = [1,0], m=1, nums2=[2], n=1`:
        *   `p1=0, p2=0, p=1`
        *   `nums1[0]=1, nums2[0]=2`. `nums1[1]=2, p2=-1, p=0`. `p2` becomes `-1`, loop ends.
        *   Second loop skipped. Final `nums1 = [1,2]`. Correct.
    *   `nums1 = [2,0], m=1, nums2=[1], n=1`:
        *   `p1=0, p2=0, p=1`
        *   `nums1[0]=2, nums2[0]=1`. `nums1[1]=2, p1=-1, p=0`. `p1` becomes `-1`, loop ends.
        *   Second loop: `p2=0`
        *   `nums1[0] = nums2[0]` (1) -> `nums1 = [1,2]`, `p2=-1, p=-1`.
        *   Final `nums1 = [1,2]`. Correct.

The two-pointer approach elegantly handles all these scenarios due to its careful pointer management and the logic for the remaining elements.

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

1.  **In-place Modification with Sufficient Capacity:** When a problem requires merging/sorting in-place into an array that has sufficient *pre-allocated* space at its end (like `nums1` with its trailing zeros), it's a strong hint to consider filling the array *from the end backwards*. This strategy prevents overwriting elements that are still needed for comparison or are not yet processed.

2.  **Two-Pointer Technique:** This problem is a classic application of the two-pointer technique. We use multiple pointers (`p1`, `p2`, `p`) to keep track of our progress in different arrays/sections simultaneously. This is highly efficient for problems involving sorted arrays, searching, or merging.

3.  **Merge Sort's Merge Step:** The core logic of the optimal solution is essentially the "merge" step from the Merge Sort algorithm. In merge sort, two sorted sub-arrays are merged into a single sorted array. The difference here is the in-place constraint and the pre-allocated space. Understanding this connection helps in recognizing similar problems.

4.  **Handling Remaining Elements:** After the primary merge loop (when one array is exhausted), correctly handling the remaining elements of the other array is crucial.
    *   If `nums2` elements remain, they *must* be copied over, as they are guaranteed to be smaller than any `nums1` elements already placed.
    *   If `nums1` elements remain, they are already in their correct final positions within `nums1` because they were never moved (or if they were, they were moved to a later position). Their relative order is preserved, and any smaller elements from `nums2` would have filled positions before them.

5.  **Complexity Trade-offs:** The problem explicitly asks for an `O(m+n)` solution. While a simple "copy and sort" approach might be quicker to code (especially in Python), understanding the complexity implications (`O((m+n)log(m+n))` time, `O(m+n)` space) is vital. The optimal `O(m+n)` time, `O(1)` space solution demonstrates a deeper algorithmic understanding.

These patterns are frequently seen in array manipulation and sorting problems and are valuable tools in a developer's algorithmic toolkit.
