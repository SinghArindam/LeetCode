Here's a set of atomic notes for LeetCode problem 27-remove-element, suitable for spaced repetition:

-   **Concept**: Problem Goal - Remove Element
    -   **Context**: Modify an integer array `nums` *in-place* by removing all occurrences of a specific integer `val`.
    -   **Example**: `nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3` should result in `nums` effectively becoming `[2,2,...]`.

-   **Concept**: Return Value `k`
    -   **Context**: The function must return `k`, which is the count of elements in `nums` that are *not* equal to `val` after modification.
    -   **Example**: For `nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3`, the returned `k` would be `2`.

-   **Concept**: In-place Modification Constraint
    -   **Context**: Solutions must operate directly on the input `nums` array, using O(1) auxiliary space (no new array of significant size).
    -   **Example**: Creating a new list to store valid elements and then copying them back violates this constraint.

-   **Concept**: Order of Remaining Elements
    -   **Context**: The relative order of the elements *not* equal to `val` (the first `k` elements) can be changed. This simplifies the in-place process.
    -   **Example**: `[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val=2` could result in `[0,1,4,0,3,...]` where the order of `0,1,4,0,3` is valid even if it differs from their original relative positions.

-   **Concept**: Irrelevance of Elements Beyond `k`
    -   **Context**: Any elements in `nums` beyond the first `k` positions (after the modification) do not matter and their values can be arbitrary.
    -   **Example**: If `k=2` for `[3,2,2,3], val=3`, `nums` could be `[2,2,3,3]` or `[2,2,5,9]` and still be considered correct.

-   **Concept**: Two-Pointer Technique (Read/Write)
    -   **Context**: The standard and most efficient approach for this problem. It uses two pointers, one for reading all elements and one for writing valid elements.
    -   **Example**: `k` (write) and `j` (read) pointers.

-   **Concept**: Read/Write Pointer: `k` (Write Pointer)
    -   **Context**: This pointer (`k`, also known as `slow_runner` or `write_idx`) tracks the next available position to place a valid (non-`val`) element. It also implicitly counts valid elements.
    -   **Example**: Initialized to `0`. `nums[k] = nums[j]` is executed when a valid element is found, then `k` is incremented.

-   **Concept**: Read/Write Pointer: `j` (Read Pointer)
    -   **Context**: This pointer (`j`, also known as `fast_runner` or `read_idx`) iterates through *all* elements of the array from the beginning to the end.
    -   **Example**: `for j in range(len(nums)):`

-   **Concept**: Read/Write Logic - Handling Valid Elements
    -   **Context**: If `nums[j]` is *not* equal to `val` (it's a valid element), it is copied to `nums[k]`, and `k` is then incremented to point to the next write position.
    -   **Example**: `if nums[j] != val: nums[k] = nums[j]; k += 1`.

-   **Concept**: Read/Write Logic - Handling `val` Elements
    -   **Context**: If `nums[j]` *is* equal to `val` (it's an element to be "removed"), no operation is performed on `nums[k]`, and `k` is *not* incremented. The `j` pointer simply moves on.
    -   **Example**: The `else` block in the two-pointer loop does nothing; `k` remains stationary.

-   **Concept**: Alternative Two-Pointer (Swap/Shrinking Window)
    -   **Context**: Another optimal approach using two pointers, one (`left`) from the beginning and one (`right`) from the end, swapping `val` elements found by `left` with elements from the `right` end.
    -   **Example**: `left = 0, right = len(nums)`. If `nums[left] == val`, swap with `nums[right-1]` and decrement `right`.

-   **Concept**: Time Complexity (Optimal Solutions)
    -   **Context**: Both two-pointer approaches have a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because each element is visited at most a constant number of times.
    -   **Example**: A single pass of the `j` pointer through the array.

-   **Concept**: Space Complexity (Optimal Solutions)
    -   **Context**: Both two-pointer approaches have a space complexity of O(1) because they only use a fixed number of variables (pointers) regardless of the input array size.
    -   **Example**: Variables `k`, `j`, `left`, `right` consume constant memory.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case: Empty Array
    -   **Context**: If the input `nums` array is empty, the `k` (or `left`) pointer remains `0`, which is correctly returned as the count of non-`val` elements.
    -   **Example**: `nums = [], val = 0` correctly returns `0`.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case: Array with All `val` Elements
    -   **Context**: If all elements in `nums` are equal to `val`, the `k` (write) pointer will never increment, resulting in `0` non-`val` elements, which is correct.
    -   **Example**: `nums = [2,2,2], val = 2` correctly returns `0`.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case: Array with No `val` Elements
    -   **Context**: If no elements in `nums` are equal to `val`, the `k` (write) pointer will increment for every element, resulting in `len(nums)`, which is correct.
    -   **Example**: `nums = [1,2,3], val = 4` correctly returns `3`.

-   **Concept**: Two-Pointer Technique - Pattern Application
    -   **Context**: This technique is fundamental for problems requiring in-place array manipulation, filtering, or compression. One pointer reads, another writes/processes selectively.
    -   **Example**: `Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array` (LC 26), `Move Zeroes` (LC 283).

-   **Concept**: Problem Statement Simplification (Order/Beyond `k`) - Benefit
    -   **Context**: The specific wording about order not mattering and elements beyond `k` being irrelevant significantly simplifies the solution, avoiding the need for complex element shifting.
    -   **Example**: If `val` is found, you don't need to physically remove it and shift all subsequent elements; you can just overwrite it later with a valid element.
