Here is a set of atomic notes generated from the comprehensive and short notes for LeetCode problem 3434-find-the-number-of-distinct-colors-among-the-balls:

- **Concept**: Problem Goal - Track Distinct Colors
- **Context**: LeetCode Problem 3434 requires finding and reporting the total number of unique colors present among *currently colored balls* after every query.
- **Example**: If balls are colored [ball1: red, ball2: blue, ball3: red], the distinct count is 2 (red, blue).

- **Concept**: Constraint - Large Ball `limit`
- **Context**: The maximum label for balls (`limit`) can be extremely large (`10^9`). This constraint prohibits the use of an array to directly store colors for all possible ball IDs due to memory limitations.
- **Example**: An array `colors[10^9]` would consume excessive memory.

- **Concept**: Constraint - Number of Queries `N`
- **Context**: The number of queries (`N`) is up to `10^5`. This constraint dictates that an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of `O(N)` or `O(N log N)` is required, as `O(N^2)` would be too slow.

- **Concept**: Naive Approach - Full Recalculation
- **Context**: A basic but inefficient approach involves iterating through all currently colored balls after each query, collecting their colors into a temporary set, and then determining the set's size.
- **Example**: After coloring a ball, collect all values from `ball_to_color_map` into a new `set()` and take its `len()`.

- **Concept**: Data Structure - `ball_to_color` Hash Map
- **Context**: This hash map stores the current color for each ball that has been colored at least once. It's crucial for handling large `limit` values efficiently by only storing relevant ball IDs.
- **Example**: `ball_to_color = {10: 'red', 500: 'blue'}` indicates ball 10 is red, ball 500 is blue.

- **Concept**: Data Structure - `color_freq` Hash Map
- **Context**: This hash map tracks the frequency of each color currently applied to *at least one* ball. It's essential for incrementally updating distinct counts.
- **Example**: `color_freq = {'red': 2, 'blue': 1}` means 'red' is used by 2 balls, 'blue' by 1 ball.

- **Concept**: Deriving Distinct Count from `color_freq`
- **Context**: The total number of distinct colors at any point is simply the number of keys in the `color_freq` hash map (`len(color_freq)`). This works because only colors with a frequency greater than zero are kept as keys.
- **Example**: If `color_freq = {'green': 3, 'purple': 1}`, then `len(color_freq)` is 2, indicating two distinct colors.

- **Concept**: Optimized Approach - Incremental Tracking
- **Context**: Instead of recalculating distinct colors from scratch, this approach efficiently updates the counts by only considering the ball being recolored, leading to `O(1)` average time per query.
- **Example**: When ball X changes color from A to B, only frequencies of A and B are adjusted.

- **Concept**: Handling Previous Color - Decrement Frequency
- **Context**: If a ball was previously colored, its `prev_color`'s frequency in `color_freq` must be decremented. This reflects that one less ball now has that `prev_color`.
- **Example**: `prev_color = ball_to_color[ball]; color_freq[prev_color] -= 1`.

- **Concept**: Critical Step - Removing Zero-Frequency Colors
- **Context**: If decrementing `prev_color`'s frequency causes its count to drop to zero, that `prev_color` is no longer used by any ball and must be removed from `color_freq`. This ensures `len(color_freq)` remains accurate.
- **Example**: `if color_freq[prev_color] == 0: del color_freq[prev_color]`.

- **Concept**: Handling New Color - Increment Frequency
- **Context**: The `new_color` (the color the ball is being assigned) must have its frequency in `color_freq` incremented. This handles both existing and newly introduced colors.
- **Example**: `color_freq[color] = color_freq.get(color, 0) + 1` (where `color` is the `new_color`).

- **Concept**: Optimization - Same Color Recolor
- **Context**: If a ball is being recolored with the exact same color it already possesses, no actual change to distinct colors or frequencies occurs. An explicit check for this condition avoids redundant hash map operations.
- **Example**: If `ball_to_color[ball]` is 'red' and the query is `[ball, 'red']`, append current `len(color_freq)` and skip further updates.

- **Concept**: Time Complexity - `O(N)` Average
- **Context**: The optimized solution achieves `O(N)` average time complexity. Each query involves a constant number of hash map operations (insertions, deletions, lookups, updates), which typically take `O(1)` time on average.

- **Concept**: Space Complexity - `O(N)` Average
- **Context**: The space complexity is `O(N)` on average. `ball_to_color` stores at most `N` unique ball IDs (if all queries are for distinct balls), and `color_freq` stores at most `N` unique color IDs.

- **Concept**: Pattern - Hash Maps for Sparse Data
- **Context**: Hash maps (dictionaries) are the go-to data structure when dealing with large ID ranges (`limit`) where only a small subset of IDs are active or relevant (`N` queries), providing efficient `O(1)` average access.
- **Example**: Using `ball_to_color` instead of a huge array indexed by `ball_id`.

- **Concept**: Pattern - Frequency Tracking
- **Context**: Maintaining a frequency map (item -> count) is a powerful pattern for problems requiring the "number of distinct items" that change over time. It simplifies updates and allows `len()` to directly yield the distinct count.
- **Example**: `color_freq` directly provides the distinct color count.

- **Concept**: Pattern - Incremental Updates (Delta Calculation)
- **Context**: This technique involves calculating and applying only the *change* (delta) caused by the current operation to the previous state, rather than recalculating the entire state from scratch. This drastically improves performance for dynamic counting problems.
- **Example**: Adjusting frequencies for only the `prev_color` and `new_color` instead of rebuilding a set of all colors after each query.
