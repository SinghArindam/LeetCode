Here's a set of atomic notes based on the provided comprehensive and short notes for LeetCode problem 26: "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array".

---

-   **Concept**: Problem Goal - Remove duplicates in-place.
    -   **Context**: Modify a given integer array `nums` to remove duplicate elements.
    -   **Example**: `[1,1,2]` becomes `[1,2,_]` (underscores indicate irrelevant values after the valid k elements).

-   **Concept**: Input Array Property - Sorted.
    -   **Context**: The input array `nums` is guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.
    -   **Example**: `[1,1,2,3,3,4]` is a valid input; `[1,2,1]` is not.

-   **Concept**: Output Requirement - Return `k`.
    -   **Context**: The function must return `k`, the total count of unique elements.
    -   **Example**: For `nums = [1,1,2]`, `k` should be `2`.

-   **Concept**: Output Requirement - In-place modification.
    -   **Context**: The modification to `nums` must occur directly within the original array object, without using extra space proportional to the input size (ideally O(1) auxiliary space).
    -   **Example**: `nums = [1,1,2]` should be transformed to `nums = [1,2,X]` where `X` doesn't matter, within the same memory location.

-   **Concept**: Output Requirement - Relative order preservation.
    -   **Context**: The order of the unique elements in the modified array must remain the same as their original relative order.
    -   **Example**: `[1,3,1,2,3]` (if sorted to `[1,1,2,3,3]`) should result in `[1,2,3]`, not `[3,2,1]`.

-   **Concept**: Constraint - Minimum Array Length.
    -   **Context**: The problem explicitly states `1 <= nums.length`.
    -   **Example**: `nums` will never be an empty array `[]`.

-   **Concept**: Optimal Approach - Two-Pointer Technique.
    -   **Context**: The most efficient and standard method for in-place modifications on sorted arrays when O(1) auxiliary space is required.
    -   **Example**: Used in problems like "Move Zeroes" or "Remove Element".

-   **Concept**: Two-Pointer Role - Slow Pointer (`i`).
    -   **Context**: In the two-pointer approach, `i` (or `slow_pointer`) tracks the position where the next unique element should be placed. It effectively marks the end of the "result" subarray.
    -   **Example**: If `nums = [1,1,2]`, `i` starts at `0`. `nums[i]` is `1`.

-   **Concept**: Two-Pointer Role - Fast Pointer (`j`).
    -   **Context**: In the two-pointer approach, `j` (or `fast_pointer`) iterates through the array to find new unique elements.
    -   **Example**: If `nums = [1,1,2]`, `j` starts at `1`. `nums[j]` is `1`.

-   **Concept**: Two-Pointer Logic - Comparison for Uniqueness.
    -   **Context**: The core of the two-pointer logic is comparing `nums[j]` with `nums[i]`. If `nums[j]` is *different* from `nums[i]`, a new unique element is found.
    -   **Example**: For `nums = [1,1,2]`, when `j=2`, `nums[2]=2` is different from `nums[i]=nums[0]=1`.

-   **Concept**: Two-Pointer Logic - Action on New Unique Element.
    -   **Context**: If `nums[j]` is found to be unique (i.e., `nums[j] != nums[i]`), increment `i` and then copy `nums[j]` to `nums[i]`.
    -   **Example**: If `nums = [1,1,2]` and `i=0, j=2`: `nums[2]` (which is `2`) is different from `nums[0]` (which is `1`). So, `i` becomes `1`, and `nums[1]` becomes `2`. Array is now `[1,2,2]`.

-   **Concept**: Two-Pointer Logic - Handling Duplicates.
    -   **Context**: If `nums[j]` is a duplicate (i.e., `nums[j] == nums[i]`), simply increment `j` and continue the loop. No action is needed for `i` or `nums[i]`.
    -   **Example**: For `nums = [1,1,2]`, when `j=1`, `nums[1]` (which is `1`) is the same as `nums[0]` (which is `1`). `j` increments to `2`.

-   **Concept**: Two-Pointer Return Value Calculation.
    -   **Context**: After the loop finishes, the `slow_pointer` (`i`) points to the index of the last unique element. Since it's 0-indexed, the total count of unique elements (`k`) is `i + 1`.
    -   **Example**: If `i` ends at `0`, it means `nums[0]` is the only unique element, so `k = 0 + 1 = 1`.

-   **Concept**: Time Complexity of Optimal Approach.
    -   **Context**: The two-pointer approach involves a single pass through the array.
    -   **Example**: `O(N)`, where N is the length of `nums`.

-   **Concept**: Space Complexity of Optimal Approach.
    -   **Context**: The two-pointer approach uses only a constant number of auxiliary variables (pointers).
    -   **Example**: `O(1)` auxiliary space.

-   **Concept**: Pythonic Slice Assignment Approach.
    -   **Context**: A concise Python-specific method using a list comprehension and slice assignment to modify the list in-place from a caller's perspective.
    -   **Example**: `nums[:] = [nums[i] for i in range(len(nums)) if (i==0 or nums[i]!=nums[i-1])]`

-   **Concept**: Space Complexity Nuance of Pythonic Slice Assignment.
    -   **Context**: While syntactically "in-place" for the caller, slice assignment `nums[:] = new_list` and list comprehensions typically create a *new temporary list* in memory.
    -   **Example**: This results in `O(N)` auxiliary space, as the temporary list can be as large as the original `nums`.

-   **Concept**: Advantage of Sorted Input.
    -   **Context**: The sorted nature of the array is crucial because it guarantees that duplicate elements are adjacent. This simplifies the logic to just comparing with the immediate preceding unique element.
    -   **Example**: Without sorted input, a hash set (`set`) would be needed, typically involving `O(N)` space.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case - Single Element Array.
    -   **Context**: For `nums = [X]`, the two-pointer approach correctly handles it.
    -   **Example**: `i` starts at `0`, `j` loop (`range(1,1)`) does not run. Returns `i+1 = 1`. Correct.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case - All Unique Elements.
    -   **Context**: For `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`, the two-pointer approach still works efficiently.
    -   **Example**: `i` increments and `nums[j]` is copied to `nums[i]` in every iteration. The array effectively copies itself, resulting in `k=N`. Correct.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case - All Duplicate Elements.
    -   **Context**: For `nums = [7,7,7,7]`, the two-pointer approach correctly identifies only one unique element.
    -   **Example**: `i` remains `0`. `j` iterates, but `nums[j]` is always equal to `nums[i]`. Only `nums[0]` is kept. Returns `k=1`. Correct.

-   **Concept**: Pattern - Two-Pointer for Array Compacting/Filtering.
    -   **Context**: This problem is a classic application of the two-pointer technique for efficiently filtering or compacting elements within a sorted array in-place.
    -   **Example**: Applicable to problems like "Remove Element", "Move Zeros to End", etc.
