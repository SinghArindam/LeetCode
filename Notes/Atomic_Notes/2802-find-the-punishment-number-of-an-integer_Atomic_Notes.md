Here's a set of atomic notes based on the provided comprehensive and short notes for LeetCode problem 2802:

---

- **Concept**: Punishment Number Definition
- **Context**: The punishment number for a given `n` is the sum of squares of all integers `i` (where `1 <= i <= n`) that satisfy a specific partitioning condition.
- **Example**: For `i=9`, `i*i=81`. It can be partitioned into "8" and "1". Their sum (8+1=9) equals `i`. So `9^2=81` contributes to the punishment number.

---

- **Concept**: Partitioning Condition for Punishment Number
- **Context**: An integer `i` is valid if the decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of their integer values equals `i`.
- **Example**: For `i=10`, `i*i=100`. It can be partitioned into "10" and "0". Their sum (10+0=10) equals `i`. So `10^2=100` contributes.

---

- **Concept**: Problem Constraints and Max Digit Length
- **Context**: The input `n` is between 1 and 1000. This implies `i*i` can be at most `1000*1000 = 1,000,000`.
- **Example**: `i*i = 1,000,000` has 7 digits. Therefore, the maximum string length (`L`) for `i*i` is 7.

---

- **Concept**: Core Algorithmic Approach - Iteration with Backtracking
- **Context**: The solution iterates through each integer `i` from 1 to `n`. For each `i`, it calls a recursive backtracking function (`isValid`) to check if `i*i` satisfies the partitioning condition.
- **Example**: The `punishmentNumber(n)` function contains a `for` loop `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)` which calls `isValid(i, i*i, i, 0)`.

---

- **Concept**: Backtracking Function (`isValid`) Base Case
- **Context**: In the recursive `isValid(target, index)` function, the base case is when `index` reaches the end of the `square` string. The partition is valid only if the `target` (remaining sum needed) is exactly `0`.
- **Example**: `if (index == s.size()) return target == 0;`

---

- **Concept**: Backtracking Function (`isValid`) Recursive Step
- **Context**: From the `current_index`, the `isValid` function iterates through all possible ending points `j` to form a substring `s[current_index...j]`. It converts this substring to an integer `sub_val` and makes a recursive call `isValid(target - sub_val, j + 1)`.
- **Example**: `for (int i = index; i < s.size(); i++) { /* calculate current_substring_val */; if (isValid(..., target - current_substring_val, i + 1)) return true; }`

---

- **Concept**: Pruning Optimization in Backtracking
- **Context**: During the recursive partitioning, if the value of the `current_substring_val` already exceeds the `remaining_target_sum`, it's impossible to reach the target by adding more non-negative digits. This branch is immediately terminated.
- **Example**: `if (current_substring_val > target) break;` inside the `isValid` loop.

---

- **Concept**: Time Complexity of the Solution
- **Context**: The overall time complexity is `O(N * L * 2^L)`, where `N` is the input `n` and `L` is the maximum number of digits in `i*i`. The `2^L` factor represents the branching, but is significantly reduced by pruning.
- **Example**: For `N=1000` and `L=7`, the approximate operations are `1000 * 7 * 2^7 = 896,000`, which is efficient enough.

---

- **Concept**: Space Complexity of the Solution
- **Context**: The space complexity is `O(L)`, primarily due to storing the string representation of `i*i` (`std::to_string`) and the maximum depth of the recursion stack.
- **Example**: For `L=7`, `O(7)` space is negligible.

---

- **Concept**: Handling Zero Digits in Partitions
- **Context**: The partitioning logic correctly handles '0' as a valid substring value, allowing it to contribute zero to the sum, which is important for numbers like 100.
- **Example**: For `i=10`, `i*i=100`. One valid partition is "10" (value 10) and "0" (value 0), summing to `10+0=10`.

---

- **Concept**: String Conversion for Digit Manipulation
- **Context**: Converting an integer (`i*i`) to its string representation (`std::to_string`) simplifies the process of iterating through its digits and extracting contiguous substrings for partitioning.
- **Example**: `std::string s = std::to_string(square);` is used at the start of `isValid` to get the string for digit processing.

---

- **Concept**: Precomputation as an Optional Optimization
- **Context**: For problems where multiple queries for `punishmentNumber(n)` might occur for different `n` values, precomputing all results up to `N_max` (here, 1000) allows for `O(1)` lookup per query after an initial setup.
- **Example**: A `static std::vector<long long> precomputed_punishment_numbers;` could store cumulative sums, then `punishmentNumber(n)` would simply return `precomputed_punishment_numbers[n]`.
