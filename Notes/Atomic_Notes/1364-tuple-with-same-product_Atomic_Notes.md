Here is a set of atomic notes based on the provided comprehensive and short notes for LeetCode problem 1364:

- **Concept**: Problem Objective
- **Context**: Find the number of unique tuples `(a, b, c, d)` from a given array `nums`.
- **Example**: For `nums = [2,3,4,6]`, the problem asks to find such tuples.

- **Concept**: Tuple Distinctness Condition
- **Context**: All four elements `a, b, c, d` within the tuple must be distinct (`a != b != c != d`).
- **Example**: `(2,6,3,4)` is valid because 2, 6, 3, 4 are all different. `(2,6,2,3)` would be invalid due to repeated '2'.

- **Concept**: Product Equality Condition
- **Context**: The product of the first two elements must equal the product of the last two (`a * b = c * d`).
- **Example**: `2 * 6 = 12` and `3 * 4 = 12` satisfy this condition.

- **Concept**: Input Array Properties (`nums`)
- **Context**: The input array `nums` consists of distinct positive integers.
- **Example**: `nums = [2,3,4,6]` (all elements are distinct and positive).

- **Concept**: Constraint on `nums.length` (N)
- **Context**: `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`. This constraint is crucial as it suggests `O(N^2)` solutions are acceptable, while `O(N^3)` or `O(N^4)` would be too slow.
- **Example**: For `N=1000`, `N^2` means `10^6` operations, which is typically fine within time limits.

- **Concept**: Constraint on `nums[i]` values
- **Context**: `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`. This defines the range of values in the input array, implying products can be up to `10^8`, which fits standard integer types and hash map keys.
- **Example**: `10^4 * 10^4 = 10^8`.

- **Concept**: Naive (Brute Force) Approach Complexity
- **Context**: Iterating through all possible combinations of four distinct elements using four nested loops.
- **Example**: Time Complexity is `O(N^4)`, which for `N=1000` (`10^12` operations) is too slow and results in Time Limit Exceeded (TLE).

- **Concept**: Problem Transformation for Optimization
- **Context**: The core insight is to transform `a * b = c * d` into finding two distinct pairs `{a, b}` and `{c, d}` from `nums` that yield the same product.
- **Example**: Instead of `(2,6,3,4)`, think of pairs `{2,6}` and `{3,4}` both having product 12.

- **Concept**: Hashing Products Frequency
- **Context**: Use a hash map (e.g., `defaultdict`) to store the count of how many unique pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` result in a specific product `P`.
- **Example**: `count_products[12] = 2` indicates that two distinct pairs (`{2,6}` and `{3,4}`) produce the product 12.

- **Concept**: Generating Unique Pairs for Product Calculation
- **Context**: Utilize nested loops `for i in range(n): for j in range(i + 1, n):` to efficiently iterate through all unique combinations of two distinct numbers from `nums` to calculate their products.
- **Example**: For `nums = [2,3,4,6]`, this generates pairs like `(2,3)`, `(2,4)`, `(2,6)`, `(3,4)`, etc., avoiding duplicates like `(6,2)` if `(2,6)` was already processed.

- **Concept**: Counting Combinations of Pairs (`C(k, 2)`)
- **Context**: If `k` distinct pairs yield the same product, the number of ways to choose two of these pairs to form `(a,b)` and `(c,d)` is calculated using the combination formula `k * (k - 1) / 2`.
- **Example**: If `k=2` (e.g., `count_products[12]=2`), `2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1` combination of pairs.

- **Concept**: Permutations for Final Tuple Count (Factor of 8)
- **Context**: For each combination of two distinct pairs (e.g., `{A, B}` and `{C, D}`) that share a product, 8 distinct tuples `(a, b, c, d)` can be formed. This is from `2` ways to order `A,B`, `2` ways to order `C,D`, and `2` ways to order the two pairs themselves (`2 * 2 * 2 = 8`).
- **Example**: If pairs are `{2,6}` and `{3,4}`, valid tuples include `(2,6,3,4)`, `(6,2,3,4)`, `(3,4,2,6)`, `(4,3,2,6)`, and their swapped second halves, totaling 8.

- **Concept**: Optimal Approach Time Complexity
- **Context**: The optimized solution has a time complexity of `O(N^2)`, dominated by the nested loops for generating pairs and populating/iterating the hash map.
- **Example**: For `N=1000`, `1000^2 = 10^6` operations, which is efficient enough for typical time limits.

- **Concept**: Optimal Approach Space Complexity
- **Context**: The space complexity is `O(N^2)` in the worst case, as the hash map `count_products` could store up to `N*(N-1)/2` distinct product entries.
- **Example**: For `N=1000`, `10^6` entries for integers is manageable for memory.

- **Concept**: Edge Case Handling: `nums.length < 4`
- **Context**: If `nums.length` is less than 4, it's impossible to pick four distinct numbers. The solution correctly returns 0 because the `C(k, 2)` formula yields 0 if `k < 2`, and loops won't create enough pairs to result in `k >= 2`.
- **Example**: For `nums = [1,2,3]`, the final `total_tuples` will be 0.

- **Concept**: Leverage Constraint: `nums` elements are distinct
- **Context**: This crucial constraint guarantees that if two *different* pairs `{a, b}` and `{c, d}` yield the same product, then `a, b, c, d` will inherently be four distinct numbers. This validates the `* 8` factor without additional distinctness checks.
- **Example**: `{2,6}` and `{3,4}` both multiply to 12. Since `nums` elements are distinct, `2,6,3,4` are automatically distinct.

- **Concept**: Leverage Constraint: `nums` elements are positive
- **Context**: All elements in `nums` are positive, which ensures that all calculated products `nums[i] * nums[j]` will also be positive. This avoids complexities or ambiguities with zero or negative products.
- **Example**: `2 * 3 = 6` (a positive product).

- **Concept**: General Pattern: Problem Transformation
- **Context**: A common strategy in algorithmic problems, especially counting ones, is to rephrase the initial condition (e.g., involving 4 variables) into an equivalent, more manageable form (e.g., involving 2 pairs).
- **Example**: Transforming `a*b=c*d` into "finding two pairs with the same product".

- **Concept**: General Pattern: Hashing/Frequency Counting
- **Context**: Hash maps (`dict` or `defaultdict`) are highly efficient (`O(1)` average time) tools for grouping elements by a specific characteristic or counting the occurrences of derived values.
- **Example**: Using a `defaultdict` to count product frequencies.

- **Concept**: General Pattern: Combinatorics
- **Context**: Many counting problems require applying combinatorics, specifically combinations (`C(n, k)`) to select groups and understanding permutations to account for distinct arrangements that contribute to the final count.
- **Example**: Using `v * (v - 1) // 2` for combinations of pairs and then multiplying by `8` for tuple permutations.

- **Concept**: General Pattern: Leveraging Constraints
- **Context**: Effectively using problem constraints (like input size limits or specific properties of elements) can significantly guide algorithm design, complexity choice, and simplify logical assumptions.
- **Example**: The `N <= 1000` constraint directly suggests `O(N^2)` is viable.

- **Concept**: General Pattern: Pairwise Iteration
- **Context**: The nested loop structure `for i in range(n): for j in range(i+1, n):` is a standard and efficient pattern to systematically generate and process all unique pairs of elements from a list.
- **Example**: Used at the beginning of the solution to calculate all unique products.
