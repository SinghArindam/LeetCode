### LeetCode 3483: Alternating Groups II - Atomic Notes

-   **Concept**: Problem Goal
    **Context**: LeetCode 3483: Alternating Groups II asks to count "alternating groups" in a circular array of `N` tiles.
    **Example**: Given `colors = [0,1,0,1]` and `k=3`, count groups like `[0,1,0]`.

-   **Concept**: Definition of an "Alternating Group"
    **Context**: A group of `k` *contiguous* tiles where `colors[i] != colors[i+1]` for all adjacent pairs *within* the group.
    **Example**: For `k=3`, `[0,1,0]` is alternating, but `[0,0,1]` is not.

-   **Concept**: Circular Array Property
    **Context**: The tiles form a circle, meaning `colors[N-1]` is considered adjacent to `colors[0]`.
    **Example**: The transition between the last and first tile must also be considered for alternation.

-   **Concept**: Input Constraints (N)
    **Context**: `colors.length` (N) is between 3 and 10^5.
    **Example**: `3 <= N <= 10^5`.

-   **Concept**: Input Constraints (k)
    **Context**: The required group length `k` is between 3 and `colors.length`.
    **Example**: `3 <= k <= N`.

-   **Concept**: Naive Approach Time Complexity
    **Context**: Brute-forcing all `N` starting positions and checking `k` elements for alternation.
    **Example**: O(N * K) time complexity, which is too slow for given constraints (e.g., 10^10 operations).

-   **Concept**: Problem Transformation to `diff` Array
    **Context**: To quantify alternating transitions, create a `diff` array where `diff[i] = 1` if `colors[i] != colors[(i+1)%N]`, and `0` otherwise.
    **Example**: If `colors = [0,1,0,0]`, then `diff[0]=1` (0!=1), `diff[1]=1` (1!=0), `diff[2]=0` (0==0), `diff[3]=0` (0==0, circular for `colors[3]` vs `colors[0]`). So, `diff = [1,1,0,0]`.

-   **Concept**: Alternating Group Condition in `diff` Array
    **Context**: An alternating group of `k` tiles corresponds to `k-1` consecutive `1`s in the `diff` array.
    **Example**: For `k=3`, a group `[0,1,0]` means `diff[start]` and `diff[start+1]` must both be `1`. Their sum must be `k-1`.

-   **Concept**: `windowSize` for Sliding Window
    **Context**: The fixed length of the window to check in the `diff` array is `k-1` because an alternating group of `k` tiles has `k-1` transitions.
    **Example**: If `k=5`, `windowSize = 4`.

-   **Concept**: Handling Circularity via Array Extension
    **Context**: To simplify sliding window logic on a circular `diff` array, duplicate `diff` to create an `ext` array of size `2N` (`ext = diff + diff`).
    **Example**: If `diff = [1,0,1]`, `ext` becomes `[1,0,1,1,0,1]`.

-   **Concept**: Sliding Window Mechanism
    **Context**: Calculate sum for initial window (`ext[0]` to `ext[windowSize-1]`), then iterate `N-1` times, subtracting the leaving element and adding the entering element to update the sum in O(1).
    **Example**: `current_sum = current_sum - ext[i-1] + ext[i + windowSize - 1]`.

-   **Concept**: Checking Window Validity with Sum
    **Context**: A window represents a valid alternating group if its `current_alternating_transitions_sum` equals `windowSize` (i.e., all `k-1` transitions are `1`s).
    **Example**: If `windowSize=2` and `current_sum=2`, increment count.

-   **Concept**: Optimal Time Complexity
    **Context**: The optimized sliding window approach has O(N) time complexity.
    **Example**: Linear operations for `diff` array, `ext` array, initial sum, and sliding window.

-   **Concept**: Optimal Space Complexity
    **Context**: The optimized approach has O(N) space complexity.
    **Example**: Due to the auxiliary `diff` array (size `N`) and `ext` array (size `2N`).

-   **Concept**: Edge Case: Minimum `k` (`k=3`)
    **Context**: `windowSize` becomes `2`. The algorithm correctly seeks 2 consecutive `1`s in the `diff` array.
    **Example**: For `colors = [0,1,0], k=3`, `diff` is `[1,1,1]`, and all 3 possible groups are counted.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case: Maximum `k` (`k=N`)
    **Context**: `windowSize` becomes `N-1`. If the entire circle is alternating, all `N` possible groups are valid.
    **Example**: For `colors = [0,1,0,1], k=4` (where N=4), `diff` is `[1,1,1,1]`, and the algorithm correctly counts `N` groups.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case: No Alternating Groups Possible
    **Context**: If the `diff` array never contains `k-1` consecutive `1`s, the `current_alternating_transitions_sum` will never reach `windowSize`.
    **Example**: For `colors = [1,1,0,1], k=4`, `diff = [0,1,1,0]`, the count remains `0`.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case: All Same Colors
    **Context**: If all tiles are the same color, the `diff` array will contain all `0`s.
    **Example**: For `colors = [0,0,0,0], k=3`, `diff = [0,0,0,0]`, the count remains `0`.

-   **Concept**: Key Pattern: Problem Transformation
    **Context**: Convert complex boolean properties into quantifiable numerical values (e.g., 0/1) for easier processing with sums or counts.
    **Example**: Representing "alternating transition" as `1` in the `diff` array.

-   **Concept**: Key Pattern: Sliding Window
    **Context**: An efficient technique for problems involving fixed-length contiguous segments of an array, avoiding redundant calculations.
    **Example**: Used to check `k-1` transitions in O(N) time after initial setup.

-   **Concept**: Key Pattern: Circular Array Handling (Modulo Operator)
    **Context**: Essential for correctly accessing elements in a circular array, especially for wrap-around comparisons.
    **Example**: `colors[(i+1)%n]` for comparing `colors[N-1]` with `colors[0]`.

-   **Concept**: Key Pattern: Circular Array Handling (Array Doubling)
    **Context**: A common strategy to simplify sliding window logic on circular arrays by making the array effectively linear.
    **Example**: Extending `diff` to `ext` of size `2N` to avoid modulo arithmetic within the main sliding loop.
