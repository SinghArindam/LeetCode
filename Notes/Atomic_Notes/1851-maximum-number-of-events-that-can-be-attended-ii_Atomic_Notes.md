Here is a set of atomic notes for LeetCode problem 1851, "Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II":

-   **Concept**: Problem Goal - Maximize Total Value.
    **Context**: Find the maximum sum of `value` from events by attending at most `k` events.
    **Example**: If `events = [[1,2,10],[3,4,5]]` and `k=1`, the max value is 10.

-   **Concept**: Event Non-Overlapping Rule.
    **Context**: If event A ends on `endDay_A`, event B must start on `startDay_B` such that `startDay_B >= endDay_A + 1` (i.e., `startDay_B` must be strictly greater than `endDay_A`).
    **Example**: Event `[1, 5, 10]` and `[5, 7, 5]` are overlapping. Event `[1, 5, 10]` and `[6, 7, 5]` are non-overlapping.

-   **Concept**: Dynamic Programming (DP) Suitability.
    **Context**: The problem exhibits optimal substructure (optimal solution built from optimal subproblems) and overlapping subproblems (same subproblems are repeatedly computed), making DP an ideal approach.
    **Example**: The max value for `k` events from index `i` can be derived from choices for `k-1` events or `k` events from `i+1`.

-   **Concept**: DP State Definition `dp(i, count)`.
    **Context**: `dp(i, count)` represents the maximum value achievable by considering events from index `i` onwards in the sorted `events` list, with `count` events remaining to be attended.
    **Example**: The initial call to solve the entire problem is `dp(0, k)`.

-   **Concept**: Pre-processing: Sorting Events.
    **Context**: Events must be sorted by their `startDay`. This is crucial for chronological processing and enabling efficient binary search for subsequent non-overlapping events.
    **Example**: `events.sort()` is the first step in the solution.

-   **Concept**: DP Choice: Skipping an Event.
    **Context**: One option at `events[i]` is to not attend it. The problem then reduces to finding the maximum value from the remaining events, with `count` remaining.
    **Example**: Represented by `dp(i + 1, count)`.

-   **Concept**: DP Choice: Attending an Event.
    **Context**: One option at `events[i]` is to attend it. Its value is added, and the problem reduces to finding the maximum value from events that start strictly after `events[i]` ends, with `count - 1` remaining.
    **Example**: Represented by `events[i][2] + dp(next_valid_event_idx, count - 1)`.

-   **Concept**: DP Base Case: `count == 0`.
    **Context**: If the allowed number of events (`k`) has been exhausted, no more value can be gained.
    **Example**: `if count == 0: return 0`.

-   **Concept**: DP Base Case: `i == n`.
    **Context**: If all events in the input list have been considered (current index `i` is out of bounds), no more events are available.
    **Example**: `if i == n: return 0`.

-   **Concept**: Optimization: Binary Search for Next Event.
    **Context**: After sorting, finding the next non-overlapping event (`next_valid_event_idx`) is optimized using `bisect_right`, reducing the search from `O(N)` to `O(log N)`.
    **Example**: `next_event_idx = bisect.bisect_right(events, [current_end_day, float('inf'), float('inf')], lo=i + 1)`.

-   **Concept**: `bisect_right` with Tuple Comparison.
    **Context**: When `bisect_right` searches in a list of tuples (like `[startDay, endDay, value]`), it performs lexicographical comparison. Padding the search key with `float('inf')` for `endDay` and `value` ensures the comparison primarily relies on `startDay`.
    **Example**: The search key `[current_event_end_day, float('inf'), float('inf')]` ensures `bisect_right` finds the first event whose `startDay` is strictly greater than `current_event_end_day`.

-   **Concept**: Memoization (`functools.lru_cache`).
    **Context**: Python's `lru_cache` decorator automatically caches the results of `dp(i, count)` calls, preventing redundant computations of overlapping subproblems and significantly improving performance.
    **Example**: `@functools.lru_cache(None)` is used above the `dp` function definition.

-   **Concept**: Time Complexity `O(N * K * log N)`.
    **Context**: This complexity arises from `N * K` unique DP states, where each state computation involves an `O(log N)` binary search operation (after an initial `O(N log N)` sort).
    **Example**: With `N*K` up to `10^6` and `log N` around 10-20, total operations are feasible for typical time limits (e.g., `10^6 * 10 = 10^7`).

-   **Concept**: Space Complexity `O(N * K)`.
    **Context**: The primary space usage is for the memoization cache, which stores the results for all `N * K` possible DP states.
    **Example**: For `N*K` up to `10^6`, storing these results (e.g., as integers) is generally within memory limits.

-   **Concept**: Constraint `k * events.length <= 10^6` as Hint.
    **Context**: This constraint is a strong indicator of the intended time complexity, suggesting that `O(N*K)` or `O(N*K*log N)` solutions are expected, rather than exponential ones.
    **Example**: If `N=1000` and `K=1000`, `N*K = 10^6`, so `O(N*K*logN)` is `10^6 * log(1000)` which is about `10^7`.

-   **Concept**: Handling Large Day Values.
    **Context**: `startDay` and `endDay` values can be up to `10^9`. Their absolute magnitudes do not affect the logic; only their relative order and differences are important.
    **Example**: `float('inf')` correctly handles comparisons with large day values in `bisect_right`.

-   **Concept**: General DP "Choose or Not Choose" Pattern.
    **Context**: Many DP problems involve a decision at each step (e.g., include or exclude an item), leading to a recursive structure with two branches.
    **Example**: The decision to attend `events[i]` or skip `events[i]` exemplifies this pattern.
