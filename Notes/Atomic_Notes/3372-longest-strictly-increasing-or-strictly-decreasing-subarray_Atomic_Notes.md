Here is a set of atomic notes for LeetCode problem 3372, formatted as requested:

-   **Concept**: Problem Goal - Longest Monotonic Subarray
    -   **Context**: Find the maximum length of a *contiguous* subarray that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
    -   **Example**: For `nums = [1,4,3,3,2]`, the longest valid subarrays are `[1,4]`, `[4,3]`, `[3,2]`, all of length 2.

-   **Concept**: Definition - Strictly Increasing Subarray
    -   **Context**: A subarray `[a, b, c, ...]` where each element is strictly greater than the preceding one (`a < b < c < ...`). Equality breaks the strictness.
    -   **Example**: `[1, 2, 5]` is strictly increasing. `[1, 2, 2]` is not.

-   **Concept**: Definition - Strictly Decreasing Subarray
    -   **Context**: A subarray `[a, b, c, ...]` where each element is strictly less than the preceding one (`a > b > c > ...`). Equality breaks the strictness.
    -   **Example**: `[5, 3, 1]` is strictly decreasing. `[5, 3, 3]` is not.

-   **Concept**: Base Case - Single Element Subarray
    -   **Context**: A subarray consisting of a single element `[x]` is considered both strictly increasing and strictly decreasing. Its length is 1.
    -   **Example**: For `nums = [7]`, the longest monotonic subarray is `[7]` with length 1.

-   **Concept**: Problem Constraints (3372)
    -   **Context**: The input array `nums` has a length `N` between 1 and 50 (`1 <= nums.length <= 50`), and element values are between 1 and 50 (`1 <= nums[i] <= 50`).
    -   **Example**: Small `N` means even `O(N^3)` might pass, but `O(N)` is the optimal and expected solution for this pattern.

-   **Concept**: Naive (Brute Force) Approach
    -   **Context**: Generate all possible contiguous subarrays. For each subarray, iterate through its elements to check if it's strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Keep track of the maximum valid length.
    -   **Example**: For `[1,4,3]`, check `[1]`, `[4]`, `[3]`, `[1,4]`, `[4,3]`, `[1,4,3]` individually.

-   **Concept**: Time Complexity - Naive Approach
    -   **Context**: The time taken by the naive approach grows cubically with the input array size `N`.
    -   **Example**: `O(N^3)` because there are `O(N^2)` subarrays, and checking each takes up to `O(N)` time.

-   **Concept**: Optimal Approach - Single Pass Strategy
    -   **Context**: Iterate through the array *once*, maintaining two independent counters: one for the length of the current strictly increasing subarray and one for the current strictly decreasing subarray.
    -   **Example**: Use `inc` and `dec` variables, updated based on `nums[i]` vs. `nums[i-1]`.

-   **Concept**: Initialization of Counters in Optimal Approach
    -   **Context**: The `maxLength` variable and the `currentIncreasingLength` (`inc`), `currentDecreasingLength` (`dec`) counters are all initialized to 1.
    -   **Example**: `ans = 1`, `inc = 1`, `dec = 1`. This correctly sets the base for single-element valid subarrays.

-   **Concept**: Logic for Updating Strictly Increasing Counter (`inc`)
    -   **Context**: When processing `nums[i]` (starting from `i=1`), compare it with `nums[i-1]`.
    -   **Example**: If `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`, increment `inc` (`inc += 1`). Otherwise (if `nums[i] <= nums[i-1]`), reset `inc` to 1, as the increasing sequence is broken and `nums[i]` starts a new one.

-   **Concept**: Logic for Updating Strictly Decreasing Counter (`dec`)
    -   **Context**: When processing `nums[i]` (starting from `i=1`), compare it with `nums[i-1]`. This is independent of the increasing check.
    -   **Example**: If `nums[i] < nums[i-1]`, increment `dec` (`dec += 1`). Otherwise (if `nums[i] >= nums[i-1]`), reset `dec` to 1, as the decreasing sequence is broken and `nums[i]` starts a new one.

-   **Concept**: Updating Overall Maximum Length (`ans`)
    -   **Context**: After updating both `inc` and `dec` for the current element `nums[i]`, update the global maximum length.
    -   **Example**: `ans = max(ans, inc, dec)`. This ensures `ans` always stores the maximum length found so far from either type of monotonic subarray.

-   **Concept**: Time Complexity - Optimal Approach
    -   **Context**: The time taken by the optimized approach grows linearly with the input array size `N`.
    -   **Example**: `O(N)` because the array is traversed exactly once, and each operation inside the loop is constant time.

-   **Concept**: Space Complexity - Optimal Approach
    -   **Context**: The optimized approach uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input array size.
    -   **Example**: `O(1)` because only a few variables (`n`, `inc`, `dec`, `ans`, loop index `i`) are used.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case - Single Element Array
    -   **Context**: For an input like `nums = [5]`, the loop for `i` will not execute (as `range(1, 1)` is empty).
    -   **Example**: The initial `ans = 1` is correctly returned, as `[5]` is a valid monotonic subarray of length 1.

-   **Concept**: Edge Case - All Identical Elements
    -   **Context**: For `nums = [3,3,3]`, `nums[i] == nums[i-1]` means neither `>` nor `<` condition is met.
    -   **Example**: Both `inc` and `dec` counters will correctly reset to 1 at each step, resulting in `maxLength = 1` (since only single-element `[3]` subarrays are strictly monotonic).

-   **Concept**: Edge Case - Empty Array
    -   **Context**: Although problem constraints specify `1 <= nums.length`, a robust solution might handle an empty input.
    -   **Example**: An explicit check `if n == 0: return 0` would return 0 for an empty array.

-   **Concept**: Design Pattern - Iterative State Management (Single Pass)
    -   **Context**: A common technique for "longest/shortest subarray/substring" problems where relevant properties of the current sequence are updated on the fly in one pass.
    -   **Example**: This problem, similar to Kadane's algorithm for Maximum Subarray Sum.

-   **Concept**: Design Pattern - Resetting Counters on Property Break
    -   **Context**: When a specific property (e.g., "strictly increasing") is violated, the counter tracking that property's current run must be reset.
    -   **Example**: `inc = 1` when `nums[i] <= nums[i-1]`, as `nums[i]` begins a new potential increasing sequence.

-   **Concept**: Design Pattern - Independent State Tracking
    -   **Context**: When a problem asks for the maximum of *multiple* distinct properties (like "increasing" OR "decreasing"), it's often efficient to track each property independently in the same pass.
    -   **Example**: `inc` and `dec` counters are maintained and updated separately before taking their maximum for `ans`.

-   **Concept**: Relation to Dynamic Programming (Implicit DP)
    -   **Context**: The `inc` and `dec` variables can be viewed as storing `dp_inc[i]` and `dp_dec[i]` values (length of longest monotonic subarray ending at `i`), where `dp[i]` depends on `dp[i-1]`.
    -   **Example**: This `O(1)` space solution effectively computes DP states on the fly without needing a full DP table.
