---

1.  **Concept**: Problem Goal - Find Unique Binary String
    **Context**: Given an array of `n` unique binary strings, each of length `n`, return any binary string of length `n` that is not present in the input array.
    **Example**: If `nums = ["0"]`, a valid return is `"1"`. If `nums = ["01", "10"]`, valid returns include `"00"` or `"11"`.

2.  **Concept**: Constraint on Input Array Structure (`n == nums.length`)
    **Context**: The number of strings in the input array (`nums.length`) is equal to the length of each individual string (`nums[i].length`). This creates a "square" structure crucial for some optimal approaches.
    **Example**: `nums = ["010", "111", "001"]` implies `n=3`.

3.  **Concept**: Constraint on `n` Size (`1 <= n <= 16`)
    **Context**: The relatively small maximum value for `n` (`16`) suggests that exponential solutions (`O(2^N)`) might pass within typical time limits, but it also hints that more efficient solutions might exist.
    **Example**: `2^16` is 65,536, which is small enough for many operations.

4.  **Concept**: Output Flexibility ("Return Any Valid String")
    **Context**: The problem states that "any valid unique string is acceptable as an answer," meaning there's no requirement to find a specific string (e.g., lexicographically smallest). This flexibility enables constructive solution strategies.
    **Example**: If `nums = ["0"]`, both `"1"` and no other specific unique string is preferred.

5.  **Concept**: Brute-Force Strategy - Exhaustive Generation
    **Context**: A basic approach is to systematically generate all `2^n` possible binary strings of length `n` (from "00...0" to "11...1").
    **Example**: For `n=2`, generate "00", "01", "10", "11".

6.  **Concept**: Brute-Force Lookup Method - Linear Search
    **Context**: After generating each possible binary string, check its presence in the input `nums` array by iterating through `nums` and comparing strings linearly.
    **Example**: If checking if "01" is present in `["00", "10"]`, "01" is compared to "00", then to "10".

7.  **Concept**: Brute-Force Time Complexity (Linear Search Lookup)
    **Context**: This approach has a time complexity of `O(2^N * N^2)`. It involves generating `2^N` strings (each `O(N)` conversion) and for each, performing `N` string comparisons (each `O(N)`).
    **Example**: For `N=16`, this is `2^16 * 16^2 ≈ 1.6 * 10^7` operations.

8.  **Concept**: Optimized Brute-Force Strategy - Hash Set
    **Context**: To improve lookup efficiency, store all input strings from `nums` into a hash set (e.g., `std::unordered_set` or `HashSet`). This allows for faster existence checks.
    **Example**: Convert `["00", "10"]` into a hash set like `{"00", "10"}`.

9.  **Concept**: Hash Set Lookup Efficiency
    **Context**: Checking for the existence of a string in a hash set typically takes average `O(string_length)` time, which is much faster than `O(N * string_length)` for a linear array search.
    **Example**: `myHashSet.count("01")` is generally a constant time operation (plus string hashing/comparison), regardless of the set size.

10. **Concept**: Optimized Brute-Force Time Complexity (Hash Set Lookup)
    **Context**: This approach has a time complexity of `O(N^2 + 2^N * N)`, which simplifies to `O(2^N * N)` because `2^N` dominates `N^2`. `N^2` is for populating the set, `2^N * N` for generation and lookups.
    **Example**: For `N=16`, this is `2^16 * 16 ≈ 10^6` operations, which is faster than `O(2^N * N^2)`.

11. **Concept**: Optimal Solution Principle - Cantor's Diagonalization
    **Context**: The most efficient and elegant solution constructs the unique string directly, leveraging a mathematical concept similar to Cantor's Diagonal Argument.
    **Example**: This principle guarantees the constructed string's uniqueness by ensuring it differs from every input string.

12. **Concept**: Cantor's Diagonalization Application for Unique String Construction
    **Context**: To construct a binary string `ans` of length `n` that is guaranteed to be unique, for each position `i` (from `0` to `n-1`), set `ans[i]` to be the *opposite* of the character `nums[i][i]` (the `i`-th character of the `i`-th string in `nums`).
    **Example**: If `nums[0][0]` is '0', then `ans[0]` is '1'. If `nums[1][1]` is '1', then `ans[1]` is '0'.

13. **Concept**: Constructive Algorithm Loop
    **Context**: The core of the constructive algorithm involves iterating `n` times, from `i = 0` to `n-1`, to build the `ans` string character by character.
    **Example**: `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { ... }`

14. **Concept**: Constructive Algorithm Character Flipping Logic
    **Context**: Within the loop, determine `ans[i]` by conditionally flipping `nums[i][i]`: if `nums[i][i]` is '0', `ans[i]` becomes '1'; otherwise, `ans[i]` becomes '0'.
    **Example**: `ans[i] = (nums[i][i] == '0') ? '1' : '0';`

15. **Concept**: Proof of Correctness - Proof by Contradiction
    **Context**: The correctness of the constructive approach is typically proven by contradiction: assume the constructed string `ans` *is* present in `nums`, then show this assumption leads to a logical inconsistency.
    **Example**: "Assume `ans == nums[k]` for some `k`."

16. **Concept**: Proof of Correctness - Contradiction Point
    **Context**: The contradiction arises because if `ans == nums[k]`, then `ans[k]` must equal `nums[k][k]`. However, by construction, `ans[k]` was explicitly set to be the *opposite* of `nums[k][k]`, leading to `ans[k] != nums[k][k]`. These two statements cannot both be true.
    **Example**: The contradiction `ans[k] == nums[k][k]` AND `ans[k] != nums[k][k]` invalidates the initial assumption.

17. **Concept**: Optimal Solution Time Complexity
    **Context**: The constructive approach has a time complexity of `O(N)`. It involves a single loop that runs `N` times, performing constant-time operations (character access and assignment) in each iteration.
    **Example**: For `N=16`, the solution performs only 16 character manipulations, making it incredibly fast.

18. **Concept**: Optimal Solution Space Complexity
    **Context**: The constructive approach has a space complexity of `O(N)`. This space is used to store the resulting `ans` string.
    **Example**: For `N=16`, 16 characters are stored in memory.

19. **Concept**: Edge Case Handling - Smallest `n` (`n=1`)
    **Context**: The constructive approach correctly handles the smallest possible `n` value (`n=1`) without special logic, as the loop simply runs once.
    **Example**: If `nums = ["0"]`, `ans[0]` becomes '1', returning "1". If `nums = ["1"]`, `ans[0]` becomes '0', returning "0".

20. **Concept**: Constraint Leverage - `n` strings of length `n`
    **Context**: The problem's specific constraint that `nums.length == n` and `nums[i].length == n` (forming a "square matrix" of characters) is crucial for the direct applicability and simplicity of the diagonal argument.
    **Example**: If `nums.length` was different from `n`, the "diagonal" character `nums[i][i]` would not be well-defined for all `i`.

21. **Concept**: Algorithmic Design Pattern - Constructive vs. Search
    **Context**: When a problem asks for "any valid answer" (rather than a specific one, like the lexicographically smallest), consider if a direct construction of the answer is possible. This often leads to significantly more optimal solutions (`O(N)`) compared to exhaustive search approaches (`O(2^N)`).
    **Example**: This problem's `O(N)` constructive solution is far superior to its `O(2^N)` search-based alternatives.

22. **Concept**: General Algorithmic Pattern - Cantor's Diagonalization
    **Context**: This problem showcases Cantor's diagonalization as a powerful algorithmic technique. It involves constructing an element that is guaranteed to be outside a given set by systematically making it differ from each element in the set at a unique, corresponding position.
    **Example**: Beyond this problem, the principle is fundamental in set theory and computability to prove the uncountability of sets or the existence of undecidable problems.

23. **Concept**: Problem Hint Interpretation - "Small N"
    **Context**: While a small `N` constraint (like `N <= 16`) might initially suggest that exponential `O(2^N)` solutions are acceptable, this problem highlights that an `O(N)` solution might exist. Always seek the most optimal approach even if a simpler, less efficient one might pass.
    **Example**: Despite `N=16` allowing `O(2^N * N)`, the `O(N)` solution is vastly more efficient and preferred.
