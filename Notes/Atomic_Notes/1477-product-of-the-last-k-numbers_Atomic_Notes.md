Here is a set of atomic notes for LeetCode problem 1477, "Product of the Last K Numbers," based on the provided comprehensive and short notes:

---

-   **Concept**: Problem Goal
-   **Context**: Design `ProductOfNumbers` class supporting `add(int num)` to append integers and `getProduct(int k)` to return the product of the last `k` numbers.
-   **Example**: `add(3)`, `add(5)`, `getProduct(2)` should return `3 * 5 = 15`.

-   **Concept**: Input Constraints for `num`
-   **Context**: `0 <= num <= 100`. This range includes `0`, which requires special handling in product calculations.
-   **Example**: `add(0)` changes all subsequent products that include this `0` to `0`.

-   **Concept**: `getProduct` Call Guarantee
-   **Context**: `getProduct` is guaranteed to be called only when the stream currently has at least `k` numbers.
-   **Example**: No need to validate if `k` exceeds the current stream size for `getProduct` calls.

-   **Concept**: Product Overflow Guarantee
-   **Context**: The product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit within a 32-bit integer.
-   **Example**: Standard `int` type can be used; `long long` or `BigInteger` are not required.

-   **Concept**: Target Time Complexity for Operations
-   **Context**: The implicit goal is to achieve `O(1)` time complexity for both `add(num)` and `getProduct(k)` operations.
-   **Example**: A naive approach with `O(k)` `getProduct` is too slow for optimal performance.

-   **Concept**: Optimized Approach - Prefix Products
-   **Context**: To achieve `O(1)` `getProduct`, a prefix product technique is used where `Product(j, k) = PrefixProduct[k] / PrefixProduct[j-1]`.
-   **Example**: To get product of `N3*N4*N5` from `[N1, N2, N3, N4, N5]`, calculate `(N1*N2*N3*N4*N5) / (N1*N2)`.

-   **Concept**: Data Structure - `prefixProducts` Vector
-   **Context**: A `std::vector<int>` named `prefixProducts` stores the cumulative product of numbers. Each element `prefixProducts[i]` is the product of numbers added *since the last `0` was encountered* (or since initialization).
-   **Example**: If stream is `[2, 3, 5]`, `prefixProducts` might be `[1, 2, 6, 30]`.

-   **Concept**: Initializing `prefixProducts` with `1` (Multiplicative Identity)
-   **Context**: The `prefixProducts` vector is initialized with `[1]` as its first element. This `1` serves as a multiplicative identity for the first number added (e.g., `1 * X = X`).
-   **Example**: `ProductOfNumbers()` sets `prefixProducts = {1}`. Adding `5` results in `prefixProducts = {1, 5}`.

-   **Concept**: Initializing `prefixProducts` with `1` (Sentinel for Division)
-   **Context**: The `1` at `prefixProducts[0]` acts as a sentinel value, ensuring a valid and non-zero denominator in `getProduct` calculations, especially when `k` spans the entire current non-zero segment.
-   **Example**: If `prefixProducts` is `[1, 2, 6]` and `getProduct(2)` is called, `n-k-1` becomes `3-2-1=0`, accessing `prefixProducts[0]` correctly.

-   **Concept**: Handling `0` in `add(num)`
-   **Context**: If `num` is `0`, the `prefixProducts` vector is reset to `[1]`. This "clears" the history, as any product including `0` will be `0`.
-   **Example**: `prefixProducts` is `[1, 2, 6]` after `add(2), add(3)`. If `add(0)` is called, `prefixProducts` becomes `[1]`.

-   **Concept**: Handling Non-Zero Numbers in `add(num)`
-   **Context**: If `num` is not `0`, it is multiplied by the last computed prefix product (`prefixProducts.back()`), and the result is appended to the `prefixProducts` vector.
-   **Example**: `prefixProducts` is `[1, 2]` after `add(2)`. If `add(3)` is called, `prefixProducts` becomes `[1, 2, 6]` (`2 * 3 = 6`).

-   **Concept**: `getProduct(k)` - Zero Inclusion Check
-   **Context**: Before calculation, `getProduct(k)` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n` (the current size of `prefixProducts`). If true, it returns `0`.
-   **Example**: If `prefixProducts` is `[1, 2, 10, 40]` (size `n=4`) due to previous `0` reset, and `getProduct(4)` is called (`k=4`), `k >= n` is true, so `0` is returned (correctly reflecting `0` in the last 4 elements of original stream).

-   **Concept**: `getProduct(k)` - Product Calculation
-   **Context**: If no `0` is implicitly included (`k < n`), the product of the last `k` numbers is `prefixProducts[n - 1] / prefixProducts[n - k - 1]`.
-   **Example**: `prefixProducts = [1, 2, 10, 40]` (`n=4`). For `getProduct(2)` (`k=2`): `prefixProducts[4-1] / prefixProducts[4-2-1] = prefixProducts[3] / prefixProducts[1] = 40 / 2 = 20`.

-   **Concept**: Time Complexity of `add(num)` (Optimized)
-   **Context**: `add(num)` is `O(1)` amortized. `std::vector::push_back` is amortized constant time, and resetting (`prefixProducts = {1}`) is also `O(1)`.
-   **Example**: Constant time operations are performed regardless of stream size.

-   **Concept**: Time Complexity of `getProduct(k)` (Optimized)
-   **Context**: `getProduct(k)` is `O(1)`. It involves constant-time array accesses and a single division.
-   **Example**: Performance is constant regardless of `k` or stream size.

-   **Concept**: Space Complexity (Optimized)
-   **Context**: Space complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of non-zero elements added since the last reset (or initialization). In the worst case (no zeros), it's `O(TotalNumAdds)`.
-   **Example**: The `prefixProducts` vector grows with each non-zero `add` operation.

-   **Concept**: Key Pattern - Prefix Sums/Products
-   **Context**: This is a fundamental technique for efficiently querying sums or products of subarrays/subsequences in `O(1)` time after `O(N)` pre-computation.
-   **Example**: Used when problems require `Sum(i, j) = PrefixSum[j] - PrefixSum[i-1]` or `Product(i, j) = PrefixProduct[j] / PrefixProduct[i-1]`.

-   **Concept**: Key Pattern - Handling Zeros in Product Problems
-   **Context**: Zeros are special in product calculations as they make the entire product `0` and break division-based prefix product logic.
-   **Example**: The strategy here is to "reset" the accumulated products when a `0` appears, efficiently invalidating previous history.

-   **Concept**: Key Pattern - Sentinel/Identity Elements
-   **Context**: Using a sentinel value (like `1` in `prefixProducts`) can greatly simplify boundary conditions and make calculations more robust, especially with division or subtraction.
-   **Example**: Ensures `prefixProducts[0]` is always a valid non-zero base for division.

-   **Concept**: Key Pattern - Dynamic Data Structures for Stream Processing
-   **Context**: When dealing with a dynamic stream of data where elements are added sequentially and queries on recent data are made, dynamic arrays (`std::vector`, `ArrayList`) are efficient.
-   **Example**: `std::vector` is used to store the dynamically growing prefix product array.
