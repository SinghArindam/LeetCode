### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to count the number of **distinct** three-digit even numbers that can be formed using a given array of digits, `digits`.

Here are the key constraints and rules for forming a number:
*   It must be a **three-digit** number (i.e., between 100 and 999).
*   It must be an **even** number (i.e., its last digit must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).
*   Each **copy** of a digit from the `digits` array can be used **only once** per number. For example, if `digits = [1,2,2]`, you can form `122` (using one '2'), and `212` (using the other '2').
*   There must **not** be leading zeros (i.e., the first digit cannot be 0).
*   We need to count the number of **distinct** final numbers. For example, if both `[1,2,2]` and `[1,2,2]` (using different '2's) result in the number `122`, it's counted only once.

**Constraints:**
*   `3 <= digits.length <= 10`: The input array size is very small.
*   `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`: Digits are single integers.

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

Given the small constraints (`digits.length` up to 10), several approaches are feasible. We'll explore them from brute-force to more optimized and Pythonic solutions.

Let `N` be the length of the `digits` array.

#### Approach 1: Brute-Force - Nested Loops (Provided Solution's Core Logic)

**Idea:** Iterate through all possible combinations of three *distinct* indices from the `digits` array. For each combination `(digits[i], digits[j], digits[k])`, form a number and check if it meets all criteria (3-digit, no leading zero, even, distinct digits used). Use a `set` to store the valid numbers to ensure distinctness.

**Steps:**
1.  Initialize an empty set `s` to store unique valid numbers.
2.  Use three nested loops for `i`, `j`, and `k` ranging from `0` to `N-1`.
3.  Inside the innermost loop, check if `i`, `j`, and `k` are all distinct. If not, continue to the next iteration (this ensures each digit *copy* is used once).
4.  Form the candidate number: `num = digits[i] * 100 + digits[j] * 10 + digits[k]`.
5.  Check validity conditions:
    *   `digits[i] != 0` (no leading zero).
    *   `digits[k] % 2 == 0` (even last digit).
6.  If valid, add `num` to the set `s`.
7.  Finally, return `len(s)`.

#### Approach 2: Constructing Numbers by Iterating Digit Values with Frequency Map

**Idea:** Instead of iterating through indices of the input array, iterate through all possible digit values (0-9) for the hundreds, tens, and units place. For each potential 3-digit number `abc` (where `a` is hundreds, `b` is tens, `c` is units), check if the required counts of digits `a`, `b`, and `c` are available in the `digits` input array.

**Steps:**
1.  Create a frequency map (e.g., `collections.Counter`) of the input `digits` array. Let's call it `cnt`.
2.  Initialize `ans = 0`.
3.  Use three nested loops to define `i` (hundreds), `j` (tens), `k` (units):
    *   `i` from 1 to 9 (no leading zero).
    *   `j` from 0 to 9.
    *   `k` from 0 to 9, step 2 (only even digits for units place).
4.  For each combination `(i, j, k)`:
    *   Make a *copy* of the `cnt` map (`c = cnt.copy()`).
    *   Decrement the counts for `i`, `j`, and `k` in `c`: `c[i] -= 1`, `c[j] -= 1`, `c[k] -= 1`.
    *   Check if all counts in `c` are non-negative. This verifies if we have enough of each digit. A convenient way is `if min(c.values()) >= 0`. Note that `c.values()` would contain counts for all 0-9 digits. If a digit wasn't in `digits`, its count would be 0, and decrementing it would make it -1.
    *   If all counts are non-negative, it means the number `ijk` can be formed. Increment `ans`.
5.  Return `ans`.
    *Self-correction*: This approach counts numbers like 202 and 220 correctly for `digits = [0,2,2]`. If `digits = [1,2,3,4]`, it will try combinations like `124`, `132`, etc. and check if the digits are available. Since `i, j, k` are values, not indices, `124` (formed by `1,2,4`) is distinct from `142` (formed by `1,4,2`). This approach naturally counts distinct numbers.

#### Approach 3: Iterating Through Valid Target Numbers (Optimal for Fixed-Range Output)

**Idea:** The target numbers are 3-digit even numbers, which fall in a small, fixed range (100 to 998). We can iterate through every number in this range and check if it can be formed using the `digits` provided.

**Steps:**
1.  Create a frequency map (`collections.Counter`) of the input `digits` array. Let's call it `c_available`.
2.  Initialize `ans = 0`.
3.  Loop `n` from `100` to `998` with a step of `2` (to ensure `n` is always a 3-digit even number).
4.  For each `n`:
    *   Convert `n` into its constituent digits and create a frequency map for these digits. For example, if `n = 220`, `n_c = {2: 2, 0: 1}`. A concise way is `collections.Counter(int(digit) for digit in str(n))`.
    *   Check if `n` can be formed using `c_available`: For every digit `k` and its count `n_c[k]` required for `n`, ensure that `c_available[k] >= n_c[k]`. This can be done efficiently with `all(n_c[k] <= c_available.get(k, 0) for k in n_c)`. `c_available.get(k, 0)` handles cases where a digit required by `n` is not present in `digits` at all.
    *   If `n` can be formed, increment `ans`.
5.  Return `ans`.

#### Approach 4: `itertools.permutations`

**Idea:** Leverage Python's `itertools.permutations` to generate all unique permutations of 3 digits from the input `digits` array. Then filter these permutations based on the problem's criteria.

**Steps:**
1.  Initialize an empty set `s` to store unique valid numbers.
2.  Use `itertools.permutations(digits, 3)` to generate all possible ordered triplets of digits. This handles the "each copy once" requirement implicitly by considering distinct positions in the input array for selection.
3.  For each permutation `p` (which is a tuple `(digit1, digit2, digit3)`):
    *   Check validity conditions:
        *   `p[0] != 0` (no leading zero).
        *   `p[2] % 2 == 0` (even last digit).
    *   If valid, form the number `num = p[0] * 100 + p[1] * 10 + p[2]` and add it to the set `s`.
4.  Return `len(s)`.
    *Note*: This approach is essentially a more concise Pythonic version of Approach 1. It naturally produces permutations of *elements from the input list* ensuring that if `digits = [2,2,0]`, `(2,2,0)` using the first '2' and second '2' will be generated, as will `(2,2,0)` using the second '2' and first '2', but `set` will consolidate them to the unique *number* 220.

#### Approach 5: Backtracking (Recursive Permutations)

**Idea:** Implement a recursive backtracking function to generate all 3-digit permutations, similar to `itertools.permutations` or a manual version of Approach 1.

**Steps:**
1.  Initialize an empty set `s` and a `used_mask` (boolean array of size `N`) initialized to `False`.
2.  Define a recursive helper function `find(path, used_mask)`:
    *   **Base Case:** If `len(path) == 3`:
        *   Form `num = path[0] * 100 + path[1] * 10 + path[2]`.
        *   Check `path[0] != 0` and `path[2] % 2 == 0`.
        *   If valid, add `num` to `s`.
        *   Return.
    *   **Recursive Step:** Loop `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
        *   If `used_mask[i]` is `False` (digit at index `i` not used yet):
            *   Set `used_mask[i] = True`.
            *   Recursively call `find(path + [digits[i]], used_mask)`.
            *   Backtrack: Set `used_mask[i] = False`.
3.  Call `find([], [False] * N)`.
4.  Return `len(s)`.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Provided Solution and Alternative Approaches

The provided solution code includes multiple commented-out approaches (Approach 1 through 6) and then uncommented `Approach 7`, which is identical to `Approach 1`. Let's focus on `Approach 7` as the chosen one from the provided code and then compare it with `Approach 3` (Iterating through valid target numbers) as a strong alternative.

#### Provided Solution (Approach 7 / Approach 1: Brute-Force - Nested Loops)

```python
import collections
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def totalNumbers(self, digits: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(digits) # Get the length of the input digits array
        s = set()       # Initialize an empty set to store unique valid numbers

        # Outer loop for the hundreds digit (first digit)
        for i in range(n):
            # Middle loop for the tens digit (second digit)
            for j in range(n):
                # Inner loop for the units digit (third digit)
                for k in range(n):
                    # Condition 1: Ensure distinct indices are used for the three digits.
                    # This means each *copy* of a digit from the input array can be used only once per number.
                    if i == j or j == k or i == k:
                        continue # Skip if any indices are the same

                    # Condition 2: No leading zero. The hundreds digit (digits[i]) cannot be 0.
                    # Condition 3: The number must be even. The units digit (digits[k]) must be even.
                    if digits[i] != 0 and digits[k] % 2 == 0:
                        # Form the 3-digit number
                        num = digits[i] * 100 + digits[j] * 10 + digits[k]
                        # Add the number to the set. Sets automatically handle uniqueness,
                        # so duplicate numbers formed by different permutations of original
                        # digits (e.g., if digits = [2,2,0], both (2_at_idx0, 2_at_idx1, 0)
                        # and (2_at_idx1, 2_at_idx0, 0) would form 220, but it's added only once)
                        s.add(num)
        
        # The size of the set is the count of distinct valid 3-digit even numbers
        return len(s)

```

**Logic Explanation:**

This approach directly implements the rules of selecting three distinct digits from the input array and arranging them.
1.  **Distinct Digits (Copies):** The `if i == j or j == k or i == k:` check is crucial. It ensures that the digits selected from `digits` at indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are unique *positions* in the original array. If `digits = [0,2,2]`, this allows `digits[0]=0`, `digits[1]=2`, `digits[2]=2` to be considered, and combinations like `(digits[1], digits[0], digits[2])` which forms `202` and `(digits[2], digits[0], digits[1])` which forms `202` are generated. The `set` then correctly identifies them as the same number `202` and counts it once.
2.  **3-Digit Number:** By selecting three digits for hundreds, tens, and units place, the formed number is implicitly a 3-digit number.
3.  **No Leading Zero:** `digits[i] != 0` handles this.
4.  **Even Number:** `digits[k] % 2 == 0` handles this.
5.  **Distinct Numbers:** The `set` `s` automatically ensures that only unique numbers are counted. If `122` can be formed in multiple ways (e.g., `digits = [1,2,2]`, using the first `2` or the second `2`), the `set` will still only store `122` once.

#### Alternative Optimal Approach (Approach 3: Iterating Through Valid Target Numbers)

This approach often performs better or is conceptually simpler when the output range is small and fixed, as is the case here (3-digit even numbers from 100 to 998).

```python
import collections
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def totalNumbers(self, digits: List[int]) -> int:
        # Create a frequency map of the available digits
        # e.g., if digits = [1,2,2,3], c_available = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1}
        c_available = collections.Counter(digits)
        
        ans = 0 # Initialize count of valid numbers

        # Iterate through all possible 3-digit even numbers
        # 100 is the smallest 3-digit number, 998 is the largest even 3-digit number.
        # Step of 2 ensures we only check even numbers.
        for n in range(100, 1000, 2):
            # Convert the number 'n' into its constituent digits and get their counts
            # e.g., if n = 220, n_c will be {2: 2, 0: 1}
            # We convert to string, then iterate characters, convert back to int for Counter keys
            n_c = collections.Counter(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
            
            # Check if all digits required for 'n' are available in 'digits' with sufficient counts
            # 'all()' checks if the condition is true for all items in the iterable.
            # 'n_c.items()' gives (digit, count) pairs for number 'n'.
            # 'c_available.get(digit, 0)' retrieves the count of 'digit' from available digits,
            # defaulting to 0 if the digit is not present in the input 'digits' array.
            # We need to ensure that the required count (n_count) for each digit in 'n'
            # is less than or equal to the available count (c_available.get(digit, 0)).
            is_formable = True
            for digit, count_needed in n_c.items():
                if c_available.get(digit, 0) < count_needed:
                    is_formable = False
                    break
            
            if is_formable:
                ans += 1 # If 'n' can be formed, increment the count
                
        return ans # Return the total count of distinct valid numbers

```

**Logic Explanation:**

This approach is fundamentally different. Instead of generating numbers from the input digits and then validating, it validates whether *known good* numbers can be formed.
1.  **Fixed Range:** It exploits the fact that valid numbers are strictly within 100-999 and must be even. This limits the search space to a fixed, small number of candidates (450 numbers).
2.  **Frequency Maps:** The core idea is to compare the *digit requirements* of a candidate number `n` with the *digit availability* in the input `digits`.
    *   `c_available`: Tells us how many of each digit (0-9) we have in `digits`.
    *   `n_c`: Tells us how many of each digit (0-9) are needed to form `n`.
3.  **Availability Check:** The `all(n_c[k] <= c_available.get(k, 0) for k in n_c)` condition is very powerful. It correctly handles:
    *   **Duplicate digits in input:** If `digits = [0,2,2]`, `c_available[2]` is 2. For `n = 220`, `n_c[2]` is 2, `n_c[0]` is 1. Since `c_available[2] >= n_c[2]` (2 >= 2) and `c_available[0] >= n_c[0]` (1 >= 1), `220` is valid.
    *   **Duplicate digits in `n`:** If `n = 220`, it correctly requires two `2`s. If `c_available` only had one `2`, it would correctly fail (`c_available.get(2,0) < n_c[2]` would be true).
    *   **Missing digits:** If `n = 124` but `c_available` does not contain `4`, `c_available.get(4,0)` would return `0`, `0 < n_c[4]` (which is 1) would be true, and `n` would correctly be deemed unformable.
4.  **Distinct Numbers:** Since we are iterating directly over integers `n` from 100 to 998, each `n` is inherently distinct. So the `set` is not needed.

---

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Let `N` be `len(digits)`. Note that `N` is constrained to be small (3 to 10).
Let `D` be the number of possible digits (0-9), so `D=10`.
Let `M` be the number of 3-digit even numbers (from 100 to 998), which is `(998 - 100) / 2 + 1 = 898 / 2 + 1 = 449 + 1 = 450`. `M` is a constant.

#### Approach 1/7: Brute-Force - Nested Loops
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N^3)
    *   Three nested loops, each running `N` times. Max `10^3 = 1000` iterations.
    *   Inside the loops, operations (comparisons, arithmetic, set insertion) are O(1) on average.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M)
    *   The `set` `s` stores at most `M` unique valid numbers. Since `M` is a constant (450), this is effectively O(1) auxiliary space relative to input size.

#### Approach 2: Constructing Numbers by Iterating Digit Values with Frequency Map
*   **Time Complexity:** O(D^3) or O(1)
    *   Three nested loops iterate over possible digit values: 9 for hundreds, 10 for tens, 5 for units. This is a fixed `9 * 10 * 5 = 450` iterations.
    *   Inside the loop: `cnt.copy()` takes O(D) time. Decrementing counts is O(1). `min(c.values())` takes O(D) time.
    *   Overall, this is `450 * O(D)`, which is a constant time operation since `D=10` is fixed. So, O(1).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(D) or O(1)
    *   `collections.Counter(digits)` stores counts for `D` digits.
    *   This is O(1) auxiliary space.

#### Approach 3: Iterating Through Valid Target Numbers (Optimal)
*   **Time Complexity:** O(M * D) or O(1)
    *   Loop `n` runs `M` times (450 iterations).
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `str(n)` and `collections.Counter(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` take O(log10(n)) which is O(1) for a 3-digit number. Creating the counter involves iterating at most 3 digits.
        *   The `all(...)` check iterates over `n_c.items()`, which has at most 3 unique digits. For each, `c_available.get(k, 0)` is O(1) (hash map lookup). So the check is O(D) in worst case (if `n` somehow had all 10 digits as a number, but it's 3-digits max). Effectively O(1) operations.
    *   Overall, `M * O(D)` operations, which is a constant time operation since `M` and `D` are fixed. So, O(1).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(D) or O(1)
    *   `collections.Counter(digits)` and `collections.Counter(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` both store counts for up to `D` digits.
    *   This is O(1) auxiliary space.

#### Approach 4/6: `itertools.permutations`
*   **Time Complexity:** O(P(N, 3))
    *   `itertools.permutations(digits, 3)` generates P(N, 3) permutations, where P(N, k) = N! / (N-k)!. For k=3, this is N * (N-1) * (N-2). Max for N=10 is `10 * 9 * 8 = 720` permutations.
    *   Inside the loop, operations (arithmetic, set insertion) are O(1) on average.
    *   Overall, O(N^3), but with a smaller constant factor than manual loops sometimes.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M)
    *   The `set` `s` stores at most `M` unique valid numbers. Effectively O(1).

#### Approach 5: Backtracking (Recursive Permutations)
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N^3)
    *   The recursion depth is 3. At each level, it iterates `N` times. Similar to explicit nested loops, generating roughly N*(N-1)*(N-2) paths.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N + M)
    *   O(N) for the recursion stack depth and `used_mask` array.
    *   O(M) for the `set` `s`. Effectively O(N) as N is small.

**Summary of Complexity:**
All approaches are highly efficient given the extremely small `N` (max 10). Approaches 2 and 3 are technically constant time since their loop bounds depend on the fixed range of digits (0-9) and 3-digit numbers (100-999), not directly on `N` in a scaling sense. Approaches 1, 4, 5 are O(N^3) but N=10 makes this trivial.
**Approach 3 is generally considered the most elegant and efficient strategy for this type of problem where the output space is small and enumerable.**

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

1.  **`digits.length` (3 to 10):**
    *   All approaches work correctly within this range. The N^3 complexity is fine. If N were much larger (e.g., 100), the O(N^3) approaches would be too slow, making the O(1) (fixed number of iterations) approaches much more preferable.

2.  **`0 <= digits[i] <= 9`:**
    *   All approaches correctly handle single digits.

3.  **No even numbers possible (e.g., `digits = [1,3,5]`):**
    *   **Approach 1/4/5/7:** The `digits[k] % 2 == 0` check will never be true, so `s` will remain empty, and `len(s)` will correctly return `0`.
    *   **Approach 2/3:** The availability checks (`min(c.values()) >= 0` or `n_c[k] <= c_available.get(k,0)`) will correctly fail for all candidate even numbers because an even digit will never be available from `c_available`. `ans` will remain `0`.

4.  **Only one unique number possible (e.g., `digits = [6,6,6]`):**
    *   **Approach 1/4/5/7:** Many permutations like `(digits[0], digits[1], digits[2])`, `(digits[0], digits[2], digits[1])`, etc., will all form the number `666`. The `set` `s` will correctly store `666` only once, resulting in `len(s)` being `1`.
    *   **Approach 2/3:** For `digits = [6,6,6]`, `c_available = {6: 3}`. Only `n = 666` will pass the availability check (`n_c = {6: 3}`, `c_available[6] >= n_c[6]`), so `ans` will be `1`.

5.  **Presence of zeros (`digits = [0,2,2]`):**
    *   **No Leading Zero:** The `digits[i] != 0` (or `p[0] != 0` or `path[0] != 0`) check in permutation-based approaches ensures numbers like `022` are not formed. Approach 2/3 naturally handles this by starting `i` (hundreds digit) from 1, and `n` from 100.
    *   **Valid Numbers:** For `[0,2,2]`, `c_available = {0:1, 2:2}`.
        *   **Permutation approaches:** They might try `(2,0,2)` (from `digits[1], digits[0], digits[2]`) forming `202`, and `(2,2,0)` (from `digits[1], digits[2], digits[0]`) forming `220`. The set will store `202` and `220`, correctly returning 2.
        *   **Frequency map approaches:**
            *   Approach 2 will check `i=2, j=0, k=2`. `c` will be decremented for `2` twice, `0` once. `c[2]` becomes `2-1-1=0`, `c[0]` becomes `1-1=0`. All non-negative, so `202` is counted.
            *   Approach 3 will check `n=202`. `n_c = {2:2, 0:1}`. `c_available` has `2` `2`s and `1` `0`. All counts match, so `202` is counted. Similar for `220`. Correctly returns 2.

6.  **Duplicate digits in input (`digits = [1,2,2,3]`):**
    *   **"Each copy of a digit can only be used once per number"**: This is key. If `digits = [1,2,2,3]`, you can form `122` using `1` (from index 0), `2` (from index 1), `2` (from index 2).
    *   **Permutation approaches (1,4,5):** They correctly handle this. `itertools.permutations([1,2_a,2_b,3], 3)` would generate permutations treating `2_a` and `2_b` as distinct entities from their original positions. For example, `(1, 2_a, 2_b)` and `(1, 2_b, 2_a)` would both form `122`. The `set` handles the final uniqueness of the *number*.
    *   **Frequency map approaches (2,3):** These approaches are naturally robust to duplicate input digits because they work with counts. If `digits = [1,2,2,3]`, `c_available = {1:1, 2:2, 3:1}`. When checking a number like `122`, `n_c = {1:1, 2:2}`. `c_available` has enough `1`s and `2`s, so `122` is correctly formed.

### 6. Clean, Well-Commented Version of the Optimal Solution

Based on the complexity analysis, Approach 3 (Iterating Through Valid Target Numbers) is the most robust and efficient for this problem's structure.

```python
import collections
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def totalNumbers(self, digits: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Counts the number of distinct three-digit even numbers that can be formed
        using the given digits.

        Constraints:
        - Numbers must be three digits (100-999).
        - Numbers must be even (last digit 0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
        - No leading zeros.
        - Each copy of a digit from 'digits' can be used only once per number.
        - The final count must be of *distinct* numbers.

        Approach: Iterate through all possible 3-digit even numbers (100 to 998, step 2).
                  For each candidate number, check if its constituent digits can be
                  formed using the available digits and their counts from the input array.
        """

        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit in the input 'digits' array.
        # This allows us to quickly check if we have enough of a specific digit.
        # Example: if digits = [1,2,2,3], c_available = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1}
        c_available = collections.Counter(digits)
        
        # Initialize a counter for the distinct valid numbers found.
        ans = 0

        # Step 2: Iterate through all possible 3-digit even numbers.
        # - A 3-digit number ranges from 100 to 999.
        # - It must be even, so we start at 100 and increment by 2.
        for n in range(100, 1000, 2):
            # Step 3: For the current candidate number 'n', get the frequency of its digits.
            # Convert 'n' to a string to easily iterate over its digits.
            # Example: if n = 220, str(n) = "220", then n_c = {2: 2, 0: 1}
            n_c = collections.Counter(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
            
            # Step 4: Check if 'n' can be formed using the 'c_available' digits.
            # We assume it's formable until proven otherwise.
            is_formable = True
            
            # Iterate through each digit and its required count for 'n'.
            for digit, count_needed in n_c.items():
                # Check if the number of 'digit's needed for 'n' (count_needed)
                # is greater than the number of 'digit's we have available (c_available[digit]).
                # Use .get(digit, 0) to handle cases where a digit required by 'n'
                # might not be present in the original 'digits' array at all.
                if c_available.get(digit, 0) < count_needed:
                    is_formable = False # If not enough digits are available, 'n' cannot be formed.
                    break               # No need to check other digits for 'n', move to next 'n'.
            
            # Step 5: If 'n' passed all checks (is_formable remains True), increment the answer.
            # Since we iterate through distinct 'n' values, each valid 'n' contributes
            # one to the count of distinct numbers.
            if is_formable:
                ans += 1
                
        # Step 6: Return the total count of distinct 3-digit even numbers.
        return ans

```

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

1.  **Iterate Output Space vs. Input Space:** When the range of desired *output* values is small and fixed (like 3-digit even numbers: 100-998), it's often more efficient and simpler to iterate through these target values and check if they can be constructed from the given input. This is typically superior to iterating through combinations/permutations of the *input* elements, especially if the input array size could be large.

2.  **Frequency Maps (Counters):** For problems involving using elements (like digits or characters) with specific counts, `collections.Counter` (or a hash map for counts in other languages) is an indispensable tool. It simplifies checking availability and consumption of elements. This pattern is very common in "anagram," "subset," or "can be formed" type problems.

3.  **Sets for Uniqueness:** When generating multiple possibilities and needing to count *distinct* results, a `set` is the most straightforward way to handle uniqueness. This is especially true if the generation process might produce the same result through different paths (e.g., `[1,2,2]` forming `122` via different `2`s).

4.  **Handling Constraints Systematically:**
    *   **No leading zeros:** Handled either by restricting the first digit's value (e.g., `i` from 1-9) or by checking the hundreds place for 0.
    *   **Even numbers:** Handled by restricting the last digit's value (e.g., `k` to 0,2,4,6,8) or by checking the units place for evenness.
    *   **Using each copy once:** This is handled implicitly by frequency maps (decrementing counts) or explicitly by using distinct indices/`used` flags in permutation-based approaches.

5.  **Small Constraints Often Imply Brute-Force is Acceptable:** For problems with very small input constraints (like `N <= 10`), even seemingly "brute-force" solutions (like O(N^3) or generating all permutations) are perfectly fine regarding performance. This allows for simpler code, but understanding more optimized approaches (like the frequency map iteration) is crucial for larger constraints.

These patterns are broadly applicable to a variety of combinatorial and string/array manipulation problems on LeetCode.
