## 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to construct a sequence of integers of a specific length, `2*n - 1`, that adheres to several rules and is lexicographically largest.

**Sequence Properties:**
1.  The integer `1` appears exactly once.
2.  Each integer `i` from `2` to `n` appears exactly twice.
3.  For every integer `i` between `2` and `n`, the absolute difference between the indices of its two occurrences (its "distance") must be exactly `i`.

**Goal:** Return the **lexicographically largest** sequence that satisfies all these conditions.
A sequence `a` is lexicographically larger than `b` if, at the first differing position, `a` has a larger number.

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= n <= 20`
*   It's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

**Example:**
For `n = 3`, the sequence length is `2*3 - 1 = 5`.
Numbers to place: `1` (once), `2` (twice), `3` (twice).
Distances: `2` must have distance `2`, `3` must have distance `3`.
Output: `[3,1,2,3,2]`
*   `3` at index 0 and 3. Distance `|3-0|=3`. Valid.
*   `1` at index 1. Valid.
*   `2` at index 2 and 4. Distance `|4-2|=2`. Valid.

## 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

### 2.1. Naive Brute-Force (Generating All Permutations)

**Approach:**
1.  Generate all possible permutations of the numbers required for the sequence. For `n`, we need `1` once, and `2, 2, 3, 3, ..., n, n` (each `i` from `2` to `n` appearing twice). The total length of the sequence is `2*n - 1`.
2.  For each generated permutation, check if it satisfies all the "valid sequence" conditions:
    *   Check counts of each number.
    *   For `i` from `2` to `n`, find its two occurrences and verify their distance is `i`.
3.  Among all valid sequences, identify the lexicographically largest one.

**Feasibility:**
This approach is highly inefficient and practically infeasible for `n > 5` or so.
The length of the sequence is `L = 2*n - 1`. The number of distinct permutations of a multiset is `L! / (1! * (2!)^(n-1))`.
For `n = 20`, `L = 39`. `39!` is an astronomically large number, far exceeding computational limits. Even checking each permutation would be too slow. This approach serves as a baseline to understand the complexity but is not viable.

**Time Complexity:** `O(L! / (2!)^(n-1))` for generating permutations, multiplied by `O(L*N)` for checking each permutation. This is prohibitively high.
**Space Complexity:** `O(L)` for storing a single permutation.

### 2.2. Backtracking (Optimized Brute-Force / Provided Solution Logic)

**Approach:**
This is a standard backtracking algorithm that builds the sequence position by position, making choices greedily to achieve the lexicographically largest result.

**Core Idea:**
To find the lexicographically largest sequence, we should try to place the largest possible numbers (`n` down to `1`) at the earliest possible positions (`index = 0, 1, 2, ...`). If placing a number leads to a valid path, we take it; otherwise, we backtrack and try another choice. Since we try larger numbers first, the first complete valid sequence we find will inherently be the lexicographically largest.

**State:**
*   `res`: An array (or vector) representing the sequence being built. Initialize with `0`s (or a placeholder for empty). Its size is `2*n - 1`.
*   `used`: A boolean array to keep track of which numbers (`1` to `n`) have already been placed in the sequence. `used[i]` is `true` if `i` has been placed (meaning for `i > 1`, both its occurrences are placed, and for `i = 1`, its single occurrence is placed).
*   `index`: The current position in `res` we are trying to fill.

**Recursive Function `backtrack(index, n)`:**
1.  **Base Case:** If `index == res.size()`, it means we have successfully filled all positions. A valid sequence has been constructed. Return `true`.
2.  **Skip Filled Positions:** If `res[index]` is not `0` (i.e., it's already filled), this means it was filled by a previous placement (specifically, as `res[k + i]` when placing `i` at `k`). Move to the next position: `return backtrack(index + 1, n)`.
3.  **Explore Choices (Try to place numbers):** Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1` (to ensure lexicographical largest):
    *   **Pruning (Number Already Used):** If `used[i]` is `true`, this number `i` has already been fully placed in the sequence (either `1` is placed, or both `i`'s for `i > 1`). Skip to the next `i`.
    *   **Placement Logic and Validity Check:**
        *   **Case `i = 1`:** Place `1` at `res[index]`. No second occurrence.
        *   **Case `i > 1`:** Place `i` at `res[index]` AND `res[index + i]`.
            *   **Bounds Check:** Ensure `index + i < res.size()`.
            *   **Availability Check:** Ensure `res[index + i] == 0` (the second position must be empty).
        *   If any of these conditions for placing `i` fail, this `i` cannot be placed at `index`. Continue to the next `i`.
    *   **Make Choice:** If `i` can be placed:
        *   Set `res[index] = i`.
        *   If `i != 1`, set `res[index + i] = i`.
        *   Mark `used[i] = true`.
    *   **Recurse:** Call `backtrack(index + 1, n)`.
        *   If the recursive call returns `true` (meaning a valid sequence was found from this choice), propagate `true` upwards immediately. This is the lexicographically largest solution, so no need to explore further.
    *   **Undo Choice (Backtrack):** If the recursive call returns `false` (meaning this choice didn't lead to a solution), revert the changes:
        *   Set `res[index] = 0`.
        *   If `i != 1`, set `res[index + i] = 0`.
        *   Mark `used[i] = false`.
4.  **No Solution from this `index`:** If the loop finishes and no `i` could be successfully placed or lead to a solution from `index`, return `false`.

**Helper Functions:**
The `constructDistancedSequence(n)` function initializes the `res` and `used` arrays and kicks off the backtracking process by calling `backtrack(0, n)`.

**Why this is optimal:**
This backtracking approach is optimal because it explores the search space in a way that guarantees finding the lexicographically largest solution first. The pruning steps (`used` array, bounds/availability checks) significantly cut down the search space compared to the naive brute-force. For `N <= 20`, this approach is efficient enough.

## 3. Detailed Explanation of the Logic Behind the Provided Solution

The provided C++ solution implements the backtracking approach described above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Member variables to hold the result sequence and tracking of used numbers
    // Declared as member variables to avoid passing them by reference through recursion,
    // which can sometimes be marginally cleaner, though passing by reference is also common.
    vector<int> res;
    vector<bool> used;

    // Recursive backtracking function
    // index: The current position in 'res' that we are trying to fill
    // n: The given integer 'n'
    bool backtrack(int index, int n) {
        // Base case: If we have successfully filled all positions up to res.size() - 1,
        // it means we've found a complete, valid sequence.
        if (index == res.size()) {
            return true; // Solution found!
        }

        // Optimization: If the current position 'index' is already filled (not 0),
        // it means some previous placement (e.g., res[k + i] = i) filled this spot.
        // We just move to the next position without trying to place anything here.
        if (res[index] != 0) {
            return backtrack(index + 1, n);
        }

        // Iterate through possible numbers to place at 'index'.
        // Start from 'n' down to '1' to ensure we build the lexicographically largest sequence.
        // Trying larger numbers first at each position helps achieve this.
        for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
            // Pruning: If number 'i' has already been used (its single instance '1'
            // or both instances of 'i' for i > 1 are already placed), skip this number.
            if (used[i]) {
                continue;
            }

            // Check if number 'i' can be placed at 'index'
            // Case 1: If i is 1, it only needs one spot.
            // Case 2: If i > 1, it needs two spots: 'index' and 'index + i'.
            //   - 'index + i' must be within bounds of 'res'.
            //   - 'res[index + i]' must be empty (0).
            if (i == 1 || (index + i < res.size() && res[index + i] == 0)) {
                // Make the choice: Place 'i'
                res[index] = i;
                if (i != 1) { // If 'i' is not 1, place its second occurrence
                    res[index + i] = i;
                }
                used[i] = true; // Mark 'i' as used

                // Recurse: Try to fill the next position
                if (backtrack(index + 1, n)) {
                    // If the recursive call found a solution, propagate 'true' up.
                    // This is the first lexicographically largest solution we found.
                    return true;
                }

                // Undo the choice (Backtrack): If the recursive call did not lead to a solution,
                // unmark 'i' and reset the positions to 0, allowing other choices.
                res[index] = 0;
                if (i != 1) {
                    res[index + i] = 0;
                }
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
        // If no number 'i' could be placed successfully at 'index' to form a valid sequence,
        // then this path does not lead to a solution.
        return false;
    }

    // Main function to construct the sequence
    vector<int> constructDistancedSequence(int n) {
        // The length of the sequence is 1 (for '1') + 2*(n-1) (for '2' to 'n' appearing twice)
        // = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1.
        int size = 2 * n - 1;
        
        // Initialize 'res' with 'size' zeros.
        res.assign(size, 0);
        
        // Initialize 'used' array. 'used[0]' is unused, 'used[1]' to 'used[n]' track numbers.
        used.assign(n + 1, false);

        // Start the backtracking process from the first position (index 0).
        backtrack(0, n);
        
        // The 'res' vector now holds the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
        return res;
    }
};

```

**Alternative Approaches (Conceptual Discussion):**

*   **Dynamic Programming:** While some sequence construction problems can be solved with DP, this problem's state definition would be incredibly complex. A DP state would need to capture the current position, the set of numbers already placed, and crucially, the specific *positions* of the first occurrences of numbers `i > 1` that are yet to have their second occurrences placed. This high dimensionality makes it impractical. The lexicographical requirement further complicates DP.

*   **Pure Greedy:** A purely greedy approach (e.g., always placing `n` at the earliest possible spot) would likely fail. For instance, placing `n` at `res[0]` might necessitate placing another `n` at `res[n]`, which could block `1` or other smaller numbers that are critical for constructing a valid sequence later. Backtracking allows "undoing" bad greedy choices.

The backtracking with specific choice ordering (larger numbers first) is the most suitable and optimal approach for this problem given the constraints.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Let `L` be the length of the sequence, `L = 2*n - 1`.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of backtracking algorithms is often hard to pin down precisely due to pruning.
1.  **Depth of Recursion:** The `backtrack` function is called recursively `L` times (from `index = 0` to `L-1`).
2.  **Choices per Step:** At each `index`, the loop iterates `N` times (from `n` down to `1`). Inside the loop, operations (array access, assignments) are `O(1)`.
3.  **Pruning:** The `used` array and the `index + i < res.size() && res[index + i] == 0` checks significantly prune the search space. Once a number `i` is placed, it (and its pair if `i > 1`) is marked `used`, preventing further attempts to place it. Since each number `i` (`1` to `N`) is placed exactly once (as a single `1` or a pair `i,i`), the total number of successful placements made throughout the *entire* valid sequence is `N`.

A very loose upper bound would be `O(N^L)` (each of `L` positions can potentially try `N` numbers), but this ignores the pruning.
A tighter analysis considers that each number `i` (for `i > 1`) must occupy two spots `k` and `k+i`, and `1` occupies one spot. Effectively, we are placing `N` distinct items (numbers `1` through `N`) into `L` slots, with constraints.
The actual number of operations is much less than `N^L` due to:
*   Numbers being marked `used` after placement.
*   The `res[index]` check (skipping already filled spots) means `backtrack` is not called for every `index` for a fresh choice.
*   The `index + i < res.size()` and `res[index + i] == 0` checks prevent invalid placements.

For `N=20`, `L=39`. An `O(N^L)` or even `O(L!)` would be too slow. The fact that `N=20` is a typical constraint for exponential time algorithms implies that the effective branching factor is small, or the depth of the search where many branches are explored is limited. The actual number of valid sequences for `N=20` is relatively small. Since we find the *first* lexicographically largest solution, we don't explore all valid sequences.

The complexity is **exponential with `N`**, but with a small constant base due to strong pruning. It is efficient enough for `N=20` (typically runs in milliseconds). A precise mathematical derivation is complex, but it's often informally stated as `O(N * C_N)` where `C_N` is the number of valid sequences, or more generally `O(N * K^L)` where `K` is a small effective branching factor.

### Space Complexity:

1.  **`res` vector:** `O(L)` which is `O(2N - 1) = O(N)`.
2.  **`used` vector:** `O(N + 1) = O(N)`.
3.  **Recursion Stack Depth:** In the worst case, the recursion can go `L` levels deep (`2N - 1`). So, `O(L) = O(N)`.

**Total Space Complexity: `O(N)`**.

---

## 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

1.  **`n = 1` (Smallest `n`):**
    *   Sequence length `2*1 - 1 = 1`. `res` will be `[0]`. `used` will be `[F, F]`.
    *   `backtrack(0, 1)`:
        *   `index = 0`, `res[0] = 0`.
        *   Loop `i` from `1` down to `1`:
            *   `i = 1`: `used[1]` is `false`.
            *   Condition `i == 1` is true.
            *   Make choice: `res[0] = 1`, `used[1] = true`.
            *   Recurse: `backtrack(1, 1)`
                *   `index = 1`. Base case: `index == res.size()` (`1 == 1`) is true. Returns `true`.
            *   Propagates `true` back. The initial `backtrack(0, 1)` returns `true`.
    *   Result: `[1]`. This is correct. The problem's constraints imply `1` occurs once, and numbers `2` to `n` twice. For `n=1`, there are no numbers from `2` to `n`.

2.  **`index + i` Out of Bounds:**
    *   This is explicitly handled by the condition `index + i < res.size()`. If trying to place `i` would put its second occurrence beyond the sequence length, that choice is skipped.

3.  **`res[index + i]` Already Occupied:**
    *   This is explicitly handled by the condition `res[index + i] == 0`. If the required second spot for `i` is already filled by another number, that choice is skipped.

4.  **`res[index]` Already Occupied:**
    *   This is handled by the `if (res[index] != 0)` check at the beginning of `backtrack`. If `res[index]` was filled by a prior placement (e.g., `res[k + val] = val` where `index = k + val`), the function simply skips to `index + 1`. This is an important optimization.

5.  **Guaranteed Solution:**
    *   The problem statement guarantees that a solution always exists. This simplifies the logic slightly as we don't need to consider the case where `backtrack(0, n)` might return `false` indicating no solution found. It will always find one.

## 7. Key Insights and Patterns That Can Be Applied to Similar Problems

1.  **Backtracking for Sequence/Permutation/Combination Generation:**
    *   When the problem asks to construct a sequence (or find permutations/combinations) that satisfies certain constraints and/or has a specific property (e.g., lexicographically largest/smallest), backtracking is a common and powerful technique.
    *   The general structure involves:
        *   A recursive function that tries to fill one position at a time.
        *   A base case for when the sequence is complete.
        *   A loop iterating through possible choices for the current position.
        *   Making a choice, recursing.
        *   Undoing the choice (backtracking) if the recursion fails.

2.  **Lexicographical Ordering:**
    *   To find the lexicographically *largest* sequence, always try placing larger numbers first at each available position. The first complete solution found this way will be the answer.
    *   To find the lexicographically *smallest*, try placing smaller numbers first.

3.  **State Management for Backtracking:**
    *   Maintain the "current" state of the construction (e.g., the `res` array/vector).
    *   Use auxiliary data structures to track constraints efficiently (e.g., `used` array for numbers, `visited` array for grid cells, etc.). These are crucial for pruning.

4.  **Pruning / Optimizations in Backtracking:**
    *   **Early Exit (Base Case):** Define clear conditions for success.
    *   **Skip Already Filled Positions:** If a position is filled indirectly (e.g., by another number's paired placement), skip it to avoid redundant work.
    *   **Constraint Checks Before Recursion:** Perform all necessary validity checks (bounds, availability, specific rules) *before* making a choice and recursing. This prevents exploring invalid branches.
    *   **`used`/`visited` Arrays:** Efficiently track resources (numbers, cells) that cannot be reused or have specific usage rules.

5.  **Problems with Paired Placements / Distances:**
    *   This problem has a unique constraint where numbers `i > 1` occupy two positions separated by distance `i`. This pattern can appear in other problems (e.g., placing matching parentheses, or colored blocks with distance rules).
    *   When a choice affects multiple future positions, ensure all affected positions are valid *before* making the choice and that they are correctly reverted during backtracking.

6.  **Small `N` Constraint:**
    *   A constraint like `N <= 20` or `N <= 15` is a strong hint that an exponential time complexity algorithm (like backtracking or dynamic programming with a large state space) is likely intended and will pass within time limits due to significant pruning or a relatively small effective search space.

By understanding and applying these patterns, similar problems involving sequence construction, constrained placements, and lexicographical requirements can be approached systematically.
