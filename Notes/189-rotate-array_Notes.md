### 1. Problem Summary

The problem requires rotating a given integer array `nums` to the right by `k` steps. This means that elements from the end of the array will move to the beginning, and existing elements will shift to the right. The rotation must be performed *in-place*, meaning the input array `nums` should be modified directly, without returning a new array. The value of `k` is non-negative.

**Example:**
*   `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3`
*   Rotate 1 step: `[7,1,2,3,4,5,6]`
*   Rotate 2 steps: `[6,7,1,2,3,4,5]`
*   Rotate 3 steps: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]` (Final Output)

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
*   `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
*   `0 <= k <= 10^5`

**Follow-up questions:**
*   Come up with at least three different ways to solve this problem.
*   Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

Here we explore various strategies to solve the array rotation problem, from naive to optimized.

#### Approach 1: Brute-Force (Repeated Single Element Rotation)

This approach simulates the rotation `k` times, one step at a time. In each step, the last element is moved to the front, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right.

**Logic:**
1.  Calculate `k = k % n` where `n` is the length of `nums`. This handles cases where `k` is greater than `n`.
2.  Repeat `k` times:
    a.  Store the last element of the array in a temporary variable.
    b.  Shift all elements from `nums[n-2]` down to `nums[0]` one position to the right (i.e., `nums[i+1] = nums[i]`).
    c.  Place the temporary element at `nums[0]`.

**Example:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`
*   Initial: `[1,2,3,4,5]`
*   **k = 1:**
    *   `temp = 5`
    *   Shift: `[1,1,2,3,4]` (conceptually)
    *   Place temp: `[5,1,2,3,4]`
*   **k = 2:**
    *   `temp = 4`
    *   Shift: `[5,5,1,2,3]` (conceptually)
    *   Place temp: `[4,5,1,2,3]`

**Time Complexity:** `O(k * N)`
*   The outer loop runs `k` times.
*   Inside the loop, shifting `N-1` elements takes `O(N)` time.
*   In the worst case, `k` can be up to `N-1` (after modulo), leading to `O(N^2)` complexity.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
*   Only a single temporary variable is used.

#### Approach 2: Using an Extra Array

This is a straightforward approach that uses an auxiliary array to store the rotated elements at their correct new positions.

**Logic:**
1.  Calculate `k = k % n` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
2.  Create a new array, `rotated_nums`, of the same size as `nums`.
3.  Iterate through the original `nums` array from `i = 0` to `n-1`.
4.  For each element `nums[i]`, its new position in the rotated array will be `(i + k) % n`.
5.  Place `nums[i]` into `rotated_nums[(i + k) % n]`.
6.  Finally, copy all elements from `rotated_nums` back into `nums` to satisfy the in-place requirement.

**Example:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`
*   `n = 5`, `k = 2`
*   `rotated_nums = [_,_,_,_,_]`
*   `i = 0, nums[0]=1`: `new_idx = (0+2)%5 = 2`. `rotated_nums[2] = 1`. `[_,_,1,_,_]`
*   `i = 1, nums[1]=2`: `new_idx = (1+2)%5 = 3`. `rotated_nums[3] = 2`. `[_,_,1,2,_]`
*   `i = 2, nums[2]=3`: `new_idx = (2+2)%5 = 4`. `rotated_nums[4] = 3`. `[_,_,1,2,3]`
*   `i = 3, nums[3]=4`: `new_idx = (3+2)%5 = 0`. `rotated_nums[0] = 4`. `[4,_,1,2,3]`
*   `i = 4, nums[4]=5`: `new_idx = (4+2)%5 = 1`. `rotated_nums[1] = 5`. `[4,5,1,2,3]`
*   Copy back: `nums = [4,5,1,2,3]`

**Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
*   One pass to fill the new array.
*   One pass to copy back to the original array.

**Space Complexity:** `O(N)`
*   An auxiliary array of size `N` is used.

#### Approach 3: Using Python Slicing (Provided Solution)

This approach leverages Python's powerful list slicing capabilities to achieve the rotation in a very concise manner.

**Logic:**
1.  Calculate `k = k % n` where `n` is the length of `nums`. This ensures `k` is within `[0, n-1]`.
2.  The rotation means the last `k` elements `nums[n-k:]` will become the first `k` elements, and the first `n-k` elements `nums[:n-k]` will become the remaining elements.
3.  Concatenate `nums[-k:]` (the last `k` elements) and `nums[:-k]` (all elements except the last `k` elements).
4.  Assign this newly formed list back to `nums[:]` to modify the array in-place. Using `nums[:] = ...` overwrites the content of the original list.

**Example:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3`
*   `n = 7`, `k = 3`
*   `nums[-k:]` means `nums[-3:]` which is `[5,6,7]` (the last 3 elements).
*   `nums[:-k]` means `nums[:-3]` which is `[1,2,3,4]` (all elements up to, but not including, the last 3).
*   Concatenate: `[5,6,7] + [1,2,3,4]` results in `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.
*   Assign `nums[:] = [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.

**Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
*   Slicing `nums[-k:]` takes `O(k)` time.
*   Slicing `nums[:-k]` takes `O(N-k)` time.
*   Concatenating two lists takes `O(k + (N-k)) = O(N)` time.
*   Assigning `nums[:]` also takes `O(N)` time as it copies elements.
*   Overall, `O(N)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(N)`
*   `nums[-k:]` creates a new list of size `k`.
*   `nums[:-k]` creates a new list of size `N-k`.
*   The `+` operator creates a third new list of size `N` by concatenating the two slices.
*   This means `O(N)` extra space is used for temporary lists during the operation.

#### Approach 4: In-place Reversal (Optimal `O(1)` Space)

This is one of the most elegant and efficient in-place solutions. It's based on the observation that rotating an array can be achieved by a series of reversals.

**Logic:**
1.  Calculate `k = k % n` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
2.  **Reverse the entire array:** This brings the elements that should be at the end to the beginning (in reverse order) and vice versa.
    *   `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` -> `[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]`
3.  **Reverse the first `k` elements:** These are the elements that originally came from the end and are now at the beginning but in reverse order. Reversing them puts them in their correct final order.
    *   `[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]` with `k=3`: Reverse `[7,6,5]` -> `[5,6,7]`
    *   Array becomes `[5,6,7,4,3,2,1]`
4.  **Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements:** These are the elements that originally came from the beginning and are now at the end (still in reverse order relative to themselves). Reversing them puts them in their correct final order.
    *   `[5,6,7,4,3,2,1]` with `n-k = 7-3=4`: Reverse `[4,3,2,1]` -> `[1,2,3,4]`
    *   Array becomes `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]` (Final result)

**Helper Function for Reversal:**
A common helper function `reverse(arr, start, end)` can be used to reverse elements within a specified range `[start, end]` (inclusive).

```python
def reverse(arr, start, end):
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
*   Each reversal operation iterates through a portion of the array, and cumulatively, elements are swapped a constant number of times (at most once by `reverse`).
*   Total operations are proportional to `N`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
*   Only a few pointers/variables are used for the `reverse` operation, no additional data structures.

#### Approach 5: Cyclic Replacements (Optimal `O(1)` Space)

This approach directly places elements into their final positions without using extra space. It involves finding cycles within the permutation.

**Logic:**
1.  Calculate `k = k % n`.
2.  If `k` is 0 or `n`, no rotation needed.
3.  Start from an index `start = 0`.
4.  For each `start` that hasn't been visited in a cycle:
    a.  Store `current_val = nums[start]`.
    b.  Set `current_idx = start`.
    c.  Loop:
        i.   Calculate `next_idx = (current_idx + k) % n`.
        ii.  Store `temp = nums[next_idx]`.
        iii. Place `current_val` at `nums[next_idx]`.
        iv.  Update `current_val = temp`.
        v.   Update `current_idx = next_idx`.
        vi.  Increment a `count` of moved elements.
    d.  Continue this loop until `current_idx` returns to `start` (cycle completed).
5.  Increment `start` and repeat until `count` equals `n`. (The number of cycles is `gcd(n, k)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor. You can loop `gcd(n, k)` times, starting a new cycle from `0`, `1`, ..., `gcd(n, k)-1`).

**Example:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 2`
*   `n=6`, `k=2`. `gcd(6,2)=2`. There will be 2 cycles.
*   **Cycle 1 (start = 0):**
    *   `current_val = nums[0] = 1`, `current_idx = 0`
    *   `next_idx = (0+2)%6 = 2`. `nums[2]=3`. `nums[2]=1`. `current_val=3`, `current_idx=2`. `nums = [1,2,1,4,5,6]`
    *   `next_idx = (2+2)%6 = 4`. `nums[4]=5`. `nums[4]=3`. `current_val=5`, `current_idx=4`. `nums = [1,2,1,4,3,6]`
    *   `next_idx = (4+2)%6 = 0`. `nums[0]=1`. `nums[0]=5`. `current_val=1`, `current_idx=0`. `nums = [5,2,1,4,3,6]`
    *   Cycle ends (returned to `start=0`).
*   **Cycle 2 (start = 1):**
    *   `current_val = nums[1] = 2`, `current_idx = 1`
    *   `next_idx = (1+2)%6 = 3`. `nums[3]=4`. `nums[3]=2`. `current_val=4`, `current_idx=3`. `nums = [5,2,1,2,3,6]`
    *   `next_idx = (3+2)%6 = 5`. `nums[5]=6`. `nums[5]=4`. `current_val=6`, `current_idx=5`. `nums = [5,2,1,2,3,4]`
    *   `next_idx = (5+2)%6 = 1`. `nums[1]=2`. `nums[1]=6`. `current_val=2`, `current_idx=1`. `nums = [5,6,1,2,3,4]`
    *   Cycle ends (returned to `start=1`).
*   All elements moved. Final `nums = [5,6,1,2,3,4]` (Correct for `[1,2,3,4,5,6], k=2` should be `[5,6,1,2,3,4]`).

**Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
*   Each element is visited and moved exactly once.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
*   Only a few temporary variables are used.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Provided Solution and Alternative Approaches

#### Provided Solution (Python Slicing)

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Step 1: Handle k > n.
        # The effective rotation steps are k % n.
        # For example, if n=7, k=10, then k becomes 10 % 7 = 3.
        # Rotating 10 steps is the same as rotating 3 steps.
        # Also handles k=0 or k=n (full rotation) by making k=0.
        k = k % n
        
        # Step 2: Perform the rotation using slicing and concatenation.
        # nums[-k:] gets the last k elements.
        #   Example: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
        #            nums[-3:] -> [5,6,7]
        # nums[:-k] gets all elements *except* the last k elements.
        #   Example: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
        #            nums[:-3] -> [1,2,3,4]
        # Concatenating these two slices gives the rotated array: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
        # Assigning this new list to nums[:] replaces the original content of nums in-place.
        # This is a powerful Pythonic way to modify a list's content entirely.
        nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]

```

**Logic Breakdown:**

1.  **`k = k % n`**: This is the first crucial step. The rotation is cyclic. If `k` is larger than the array's length `n`, then `k` steps are equivalent to `k % n` steps. For instance, rotating an array of length 7 by 10 steps is the same as rotating it by 3 steps (10 % 7 = 3). This also correctly handles `k = 0` (no rotation) and `k = n` (full rotation, which is also no effective rotation) by reducing them to `k = 0`.

2.  **`nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]`**: This is the core of the Pythonic solution.
    *   `nums[-k:]`: This slice extracts the last `k` elements of the array. For a right rotation, these are precisely the elements that should move to the *front* of the array.
    *   `nums[:-k]`: This slice extracts all elements from the beginning of the array up to (but not including) the last `k` elements. These are the elements that should occupy the *remaining positions* after the `k` elements from the end have moved to the front.
    *   `... + ...`: The `+` operator concatenates these two new lists (the slices create new lists). The result is a new list with the elements in their rotated order.
    *   `nums[:] = ...`: This assignment is key for in-place modification. When you assign to `nums[:]`, Python replaces the *entire content* of the `nums` list with the elements from the list on the right-hand side. This modifies the original `nums` object, satisfying the in-place requirement. If you were to do `nums = ...`, it would rebind the `nums` variable to a new list object, which would not be an in-place modification of the original list passed to the function.

#### Alternative Approach: In-place Reversal (Recommended Optimal Solution)

As discussed in Approach 4, the reversal method is a highly optimized O(1) space solution.

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        # Handle cases where n is 0 or 1, or k is 0, or k is a multiple of n
        # In all these cases, no effective rotation is needed.
        if n == 0 or n == 1 or k == 0:
            return
            
        # Calculate the effective number of rotations
        # If k > n, then k rotations is equivalent to k % n rotations.
        # Example: [1,2,3,4,5], k=7 (n=5). k becomes 7 % 5 = 2.
        # This handles k=n (e.g., k=5, n=5 -> k=0), meaning no rotation needed.
        k = k % n
        
        # If k becomes 0 after modulo, it means no effective rotation.
        if k == 0:
            return

        # Helper function to reverse a portion of the array in-place
        def reverse(arr, start, end):
            while start < end:
                # Swap elements at start and end pointers
                arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
                start += 1 # Move start pointer forward
                end -= 1   # Move end pointer backward

        # Step 1: Reverse the entire array
        # Example: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
        # After this, the elements that should be at the end are at the beginning (reversed),
        # and vice-versa.
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1)
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the first k elements
        # These are the elements that were originally at the end and now are at the beginning.
        # Reversing them puts them in their correct final order.
        # Example: [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], k=3
        # Reverse [7,6,5] -> [5,6,7]
        # Array becomes: [5,6,7,4,3,2,1]
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1)
        
        # Step 3: Reverse the remaining n-k elements
        # These are the elements that were originally at the beginning and now are at the end.
        # Reversing them puts them in their correct final order.
        # Example: [5,6,7,4,3,2,1], n-k = 7-3=4
        # Reverse [4,3,2,1] -> [1,2,3,4]
        # Array becomes: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] (Final Correct Output)
        reverse(nums, k, n - 1)

```

**Logic Breakdown for In-place Reversal:**

The reversal method works because a right rotation of `k` steps means the last `k` elements move to the front, and the first `n-k` elements move to the end.

1.  **Full Reverse `[0, n-1]`**: This initial reversal swaps elements such that the elements that *should* end up at the front are now at the *beginning* of the array (but in reverse order among themselves), and similarly for the elements that should end up at the end.
    *   Original: `[A_part | B_part]` where `A_part` are first `n-k` elements, `B_part` are last `k` elements.
    *   Desired: `[B_part | A_part]`
    *   After full reverse: `[reverse(B_part) | reverse(A_part)]`

2.  **Reverse First `k` Elements `[0, k-1]`**: This section now contains `reverse(B_part)`. By reversing it again, we get `B_part` in its correct order.
    *   Array becomes: `[B_part | reverse(A_part)]`

3.  **Reverse Last `n-k` Elements `[k, n-1]`**: This section now contains `reverse(A_part)`. By reversing it again, we get `A_part` in its correct order.
    *   Array becomes: `[B_part | A_part]`, which is the correct rotated array.

| :----------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brute-Force (Repeated Single Rotation)** | `O(N * k)`      | `O(1)`           | `k` can be up to `N-1` (after modulo), leading to `O(N^2)` worst-case. Inefficient for large `N` or `k`.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Using Extra Array**          | `O(N)`          | `O(N)`           | Simple to understand and implement. Good for non-in-place requirements, but violates `O(1)` space constraint for follow-up.                                                                                                                   |
| **Python Slicing (Provided Solution)** | `O(N)`          | `O(N)`           | Pythonic and concise.

A classic and widely used technique for array rotations.                                                                                                                               |
| **Cyclic Replacements**        | `O(N)`          | `O(1)`           | Also highly efficient and meets `O(1)` space. Can be slightly more complex to implement correctly due to cycle detection logic.                                                                                                                |

**Conclusion on Optimal Solution:**
Both "In-place Reversal" and "Cyclic Replacements" are optimal in terms of both time (`O(N)`) and space (`O(1)`). The "In-place Reversal" is generally preferred for its simplicity and clear logic.

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

1.  **`k = 0`**:
    *   **Handled:** `k = k % n` will result in `k = 0`. All approaches correctly perform no rotation or handle this with an early exit (`if k == 0: return`).
2.  **`k > n` (where `n` is `len(nums)`)**:
    *   **Handled:** `k = k % n` correctly reduces `k` to its effective number of rotations within the array's length. E.g., rotating by `n` steps is the same as 0 steps. Rotating by `n+1` steps is the same as 1 step.
3.  **`nums.length = 1`**:
    *   **Handled:** `k = k % 1` will always result in `k = 0`. The array remains unchanged, which is correct. Most solutions will implicitly handle this, but an explicit `if n <= 1: return` is also robust.
4.  **`nums.length = 0`**:
    *   **Constraints:** Problem states `1 <= nums.length`. So, an empty array is not a valid input per constraints. If it were, an explicit check `if not nums: return` would be needed.
5.  **`k` is a multiple of `n` (e.g., `k=n`, `k=2n`)**:
    *   **Handled:** `k = k % n` will correctly result in `k = 0`, leading to no effective rotation, which is accurate.
6.  **Negative numbers in `nums`**:
    *   **Handled:** The values of the elements (`nums[i]`) do not affect the rotation logic itself, only their positions. All approaches work correctly regardless of the signs of the numbers.
7.  **Negative `k`**:
    *   **Constraints:** Problem states `0 <= k`. So, `k` will always be non-negative. If `k` could be negative, it would imply a left rotation, which would require different handling (e.g., `k = (k % n + n) % n` for effective positive k, or separate logic for left rotation).

### 6. Clean, Well-Commented Version of the Optimal Solution

The In-place Reversal method is chosen as the optimal solution for its `O(1)` space complexity and relative simplicity compared to cyclic replacements.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Rotates the given array nums to the right by k steps in-place.
        This solution uses the three-reversal trick, which is optimal with O(1) space complexity.

        Args:
            nums: The list of integers to be rotated. Modified in-place.
            k: The number of steps to rotate to the right (non-negative).
        """
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Handle edge cases and calculate effective k
        # If the array is empty or has only one element, no rotation is needed.
        # If k is 0, no rotation is needed.
        if n == 0 or n == 1 or k == 0:
            return
            
        # Calculate the effective number of rotations.
        # If k is greater than the array length n, rotating k steps is
        # equivalent to rotating (k % n) steps.
        # Example: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 7 (n=5)
        # Effective k becomes 7 % 5 = 2.
        # This also correctly handles cases where k is a multiple of n (e.g., k=5, n=5 -> k=0).
        k = k % n
        
        # If k becomes 0 after modulo (e.g., k was a multiple of n),
        # it means no effective rotation is needed.
        if k == 0:
            return

        # Helper function to reverse a portion of the array.
        # This function swaps elements from 'start' to 'end' (inclusive).
        def reverse(arr: List[int], start: int, end: int) -> None:
            """
            Reverses the sub-array from arr[start] to arr[end] in-place.
            """
            while start < end:
                arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
                start += 1
                end -= 1

        # The Three-Reversal Algorithm:
        # A right rotation by k steps can be achieved by:
        # 1. Reversing the entire array.
        # 2. Reversing the first k elements.
        # 3. Reversing the remaining (n - k) elements.

        # Step 1: Reverse the entire array.
        # Example: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] becomes [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
        # Now, the elements that should eventually be at the end are at the beginning (in reverse order),
        # and vice-versa.
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1)
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the first k elements.
        # These are the elements that were originally at the end and now correctly positioned
        # at the beginning, but still in reverse order among themselves.
        # Example: For [7,6,5,4,3,2,1] with k=3, reverse [7,6,5] to get [5,6,7].
        # Array becomes: [5,6,7,4,3,2,1]
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1)
        
        # Step 3: Reverse the remaining (n - k) elements.
        # These are the elements that were originally at the beginning and now correctly positioned
        # at the end, but still in reverse order among themselves.
        # Example: For [5,6,7,4,3,2,1], reverse [4,3,2,1] (from index k=3 to n-1=6) to get [1,2,3,4].
        # Array becomes: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] (This is the final desired rotated array).
        reverse(nums, k, n - 1)

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

1.  **Modulo Arithmetic for Rotations**: When dealing with cyclic shifts or rotations, `k = k % n` is almost always the first step. It simplifies the problem by converting `k` to its effective number of steps within one full cycle, handling `k > n` and `k = n` (full rotation is 0 effective steps).

2.  **In-place Modification Techniques**:
    *   **Swapping elements**: The `(arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start])` pattern is fundamental for in-place modifications like reversing or bubble sort.
    *   **Three-Reversal Trick**: This is a powerful and elegant pattern for array rotations that achieves `O(1)` space. It decomposes a complex rotation into three simpler reversal operations. This pattern is worth remembering.
    *   **Cyclic Replacement**: Another `O(1)` space technique that directly places elements. It's useful when elements follow a clear cyclic mapping, and you need to avoid intermediate storage.

3.  **Problem Decomposition**: The reversal method showcases how a seemingly complex operation (array rotation) can be broken down into simpler, well-understood operations (reversals). This is a general problem-solving strategy: can the problem be reduced to subproblems whose solutions are known or easier to find?

4.  **Pythonic vs. Algorithmic Space Complexity**: Be aware of Python's conveniences like list slicing and concatenation. While they make code concise, they often involve creating new temporary list objects, leading to `O(N)` space complexity from an algorithmic perspective, even if the code looks "short" or "in-place" due to `[:]` assignment. For true `O(1)` space, manual element manipulation (like in-place swaps/reversals) is usually required.

5.  **Understanding Array Indexing and Slicing**: Familiarity with `nums[start:end]`, `nums[:end]`, `nums[start:]`, and `nums[-k:]` is crucial for efficient Python array manipulation. Understanding how `nums[:] = new_list` works to modify the list in-place is also key.

These insights are applicable to a wide range of array manipulation problems, especially those involving permutations, rearrangements, or cyclic shifts.
