### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to calculate the "punishment number" for a given positive integer `n`. The punishment number is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers `i` that satisfy two conditions:

1.  `1 <= i <= n`
2.  The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.

**Example:**
*   For `n = 10`:
    *   `i = 1`: `1 * 1 = 1`. Can be partitioned into "1" (sum = 1). Valid. Add `1^2 = 1`.
    *   `i = 9`: `9 * 9 = 81`. Can be partitioned into "8" and "1" (sum = 8 + 1 = 9). Valid. Add `9^2 = 81`.
    *   `i = 10`: `10 * 10 = 100`. Can be partitioned into "10" and "0" (sum = 10 + 0 = 10). Valid. Add `10^2 = 100`.
    *   Other `i` values (2-8) do not satisfy the condition.
    *   Punishment number for `n = 10` is `1 + 81 + 100 = 182`.

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

The core of this problem lies in checking the second condition: "The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`." This is a classic partitioning problem, which can be solved using recursion with backtracking.

#### 2.1. Naive Approach (Brute-Force Partitioning)

For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`:
1.  Calculate `square = i * i`.
2.  Convert `square` to its string representation, let's say `s_square`.
3.  Recursively explore all possible ways to partition `s_square` into contiguous substrings.
    *   For each partition, calculate the sum of the integer values of the substrings.
    *   If this sum equals `i`, then `i` is a valid number, and we add `square` to our total punishment number.

**How to partition recursively:**
A recursive function `can_partition(current_index, remaining_target_sum)` can be defined:
*   **Base Case:** If `current_index` reaches the end of `s_square`:
    *   Return `true` if `remaining_target_sum` is 0 (meaning all parts summed up to `i`).
    *   Return `false` otherwise.
*   **Recursive Step:** Iterate from `current_index` to the end of `s_square`.
    *   For each `j`, consider the substring `s_square[current_index...j]`.
    *   Convert this substring to an integer `sub_val`.
    *   If `sub_val > remaining_target_sum`, this path is invalid, so prune this branch (no need to continue with longer substrings from `current_index`).
    *   Recursively call `can_partition(j + 1, remaining_target_sum - sub_val)`.
    *   If any recursive call returns `true`, then a valid partition is found, so return `true` immediately.
*   If the loop finishes without finding a valid partition, return `false`.

This naive approach directly implements the problem definition. Given the constraints, it turns out to be efficient enough.

#### 2.2. Optimized Approach (Precomputation/Memoization)

The "naive" recursive approach described above is actually quite efficient because the length of the string representation of `i * i` is very small.
For `i <= 1000`, `i * i <= 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000`.
The maximum number of digits (`L`) in `i * i` is 7 (for 1,000,000).

The complexity of partitioning a string of length `L` is roughly `O(2^L * L)` in the worst case (where `L` is the maximum depth of recursion, and `L` operations are done per step). For `L=7`, `2^7 = 128`. This is a very small number.

**Optimization opportunities:**
1.  **Pruning:** The `if (sub_val > remaining_target_sum) break;` is a crucial optimization. It ensures we don't explore paths where accumulated substring values exceed the required sum.
2.  **Memoization (Dynamic Programming):** The recursive `can_partition` function has state `(current_index, remaining_target_sum)`. If the same state is reached multiple times, we could memoize the result. However, for a given `i`, the `remaining_target_sum` decreases, and `current_index` increases, so the exact same `(index, target)` state might not repeat frequently enough to offer significant gains over the basic pruning, especially with such small `L`.
3.  **Precomputation:** Since `N` is small (`1000`), we could precompute all valid `i` values up to `N` once and store their squares in a lookup table (e.g., a boolean array or a hash set). Then, for any `n` query, we just iterate from 1 to `n` and sum up the precomputed squares.
    *   This is typically faster if there are multiple queries for `punishmentNumber(n)` for different `n`, but for a single call as in LeetCode, it means running the `N * O(2^L * L)` calculation upfront. The asymptotic complexity doesn't change for a single call, but it can be faster in practice by avoiding repeated string conversions/checks for small `i` values if they are frequently queried.

The provided solution uses the "Naive Approach" with the pruning optimization, which is perfectly adequate given the constraints. It iterates `i` from 1 to `n` and calls a recursive helper function `isValid` for each `i`.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Logic Behind the Provided Solution

The provided C++ solution implements the optimized brute-force (backtracking) approach.

#### 3.1. `punishmentNumber(int n)` Function

This is the main function.
*   It initializes `sum = 0` to accumulate the squares of valid integers.
*   It iterates `i` from `1` up to `n` (inclusive).
*   Inside the loop:
    *   It calculates `square = i * i`.
    *   It calls a helper function `isValid(i, square, i, 0)`. This function checks if `square` can be partitioned such that the sum of its parts equals the original `i`.
        *   `num`: The original integer `i` (not strictly needed in `isValid` but passed).
        *   `square`: The squared value `i * i`.
        *   `target`: The sum we are trying to achieve with partitions (initially `i`).
        *   `index`: The starting index in the string representation of `square` for the current partitioning attempt (initially 0).
    *   If `isValid` returns `true`, it means `i` satisfies the condition. So, `square` (`i * i`) is added to the `sum`.
*   Finally, it returns the total `sum`.

#### 3.2. `isValid(int num, int square, int target, int index)` Function

This is a recursive (backtracking) helper function that attempts to partition the string representation of `square` into contiguous substrings whose sum equals `target`.

*   **Parameters:**
    *   `num`: The original integer `i` (not used in the logic, but carried through).
    *   `square`: The `i * i` value. It's passed as an `int` but converted to `string` inside the function.
    *   `target`: The remaining sum that needs to be achieved by partitioning the rest of the `square` string.
    *   `index`: The starting index in the `square` string from which to form new substrings.

*   **String Conversion:**
    *   `string s = to_string(square);` converts the integer `square` into its decimal string representation. This happens *every time* `isValid` is called, which could be slightly inefficient. Converting it once in `punishmentNumber` and passing `s` or using a global/member string would be a minor optimization. Given `L` is small, it's not a bottleneck.

*   **Base Case:**
    *   `if (index == s.size()) return target == 0;`
        *   If `index` has reached the end of the string `s`, it means all digits have been processed.
        *   The partition is valid *only if* the `target` (remaining sum needed) is exactly `0`. If `target > 0`, it means we still needed to sum more, but ran out of digits. If `target < 0`, it means we overshot the sum.

*   **Recursive Step (Backtracking Loop):**
    *   `int sum = 0;` : This `sum` variable accumulates the value of the *current* substring being formed. It's re-initialized for each `isValid` call.
    *   `for (int i = index; i < s.size(); i++)`: This loop iterates through possible ending points (`i`) for the current substring, starting from `index`.
        *   `sum = sum * 10 + (s[i] - '0');`: This line builds the integer value of the substring `s[index...i]`. For example, if `s = "123"` and `index = 0`:
            *   `i = 0`: `sum = 1` (substring "1")
            *   `i = 1`: `sum = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12` (substring "12")
            *   `i = 2`: `sum = 12 * 10 + 3 = 123` (substring "123")
        *   `if (sum > target) break;`: **Pruning Optimization.** If the current substring value `sum` already exceeds the `target` (remaining sum), then this path cannot possibly lead to a valid solution (because all digits are non-negative, so adding more digits will only increase `sum`). We `break` from the loop and try different partitions starting from an earlier index (or return `false` if this was the first segment).
        *   `if (isValid(num, square, target - sum, i + 1)) return true;`: This is the recursive call.
            *   We assume `sum` (the current substring value) is one part of the partition.
            *   We then try to find if the *rest* of the string (`s` from `i + 1` onwards) can be partitioned to sum up to `target - sum`.
            *   If this recursive call returns `true`, it means a complete valid partition has been found. We immediately `return true` to propagate this success up the call stack.

*   **Failure Case:**
    *   If the `for` loop completes without any recursive call returning `true`, it means no valid partition can be formed from `index` that sums to `target`. In this case, the function `return false;`.

#### 3.3. Alternative Approaches (Not taken by provided solution, but discussed)

*   **Dynamic Programming (for `isValid`):**
    *   One could define `dp[idx][current_sum]` as a boolean indicating if `s[idx:]` can be partitioned to sum to `current_sum`.
    *   This would typically require a 2D DP table. The `target` sum can go up to `N` (1000). The length of string `L` is small (up to 7).
    *   `dp[idx][current_sum]` would be `true` if there exists `j` such that `s[idx...j]` has value `v` and `dp[j+1][current_sum - v]` is `true`.
    *   Base case `dp[s.length()][0] = true`.
    *   However, the state `(target)` also changes. So it's not a fixed `current_sum` for a given `i`.
    *   The current recursive solution *is* a form of top-down DP with implicit memoization if the problem structure allows for repeated states, but given `target` always decreases and `index` always increases, distinct states might not repeat often for a fixed `i`. So, explicit memoization might offer marginal benefits here.
*   **Precomputation (for `punishmentNumber`):**
    *   For competitive programming, if `n` can be large or there are many queries, precomputing all valid `i` values (and their squares) up to `1000` is common.
    *   ```cpp
        // static std::vector<long long> precomputed_punishment_numbers;
        // static bool precomputed = false;

        // void precompute() {
        //     if (precomputed) return;
        //     precomputed_punishment_numbers.resize(1001, 0); // Stores sum up to i
        //     long long current_total = 0;
        //     for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; ++i) {
        //         long long square = (long long)i * i;
        //         if (isValid(i, square, i, 0)) { // Need to adjust isValid signature
        //             current_total += square;
        //         }
        //         precomputed_punishment_numbers[i] = current_total;
        //     }
        //     precomputed = true;
        // }

        // int punishmentNumber(int n) {
        //     precompute();
        //     return precomputed_punishment_numbers[n];
        // }
        ```
    *   This makes `punishmentNumber(n)` an `O(1)` lookup after an initial `O(N * L * 2^L)` setup.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Let `N` be the input `n`.
Let `L` be the maximum number of digits in `i * i`. For `i <= 1000`, `i * i <= 1,000,000`, so `L` is at most 7.

#### 4.1. Time Complexity

*   **Outer Loop (`punishmentNumber`):** Iterates `N` times (from `i = 1` to `n`).
*   **Inner Function (`isValid`):**
    *   String conversion `to_string(square)`: Takes `O(L)` time. This is done at the beginning of each `isValid` call.
    *   The recursive nature of `isValid` explores different partitions. For a string of length `L`, there are `2^(L-1)` ways to insert dividers. In the worst case, each path involves `L` recursive calls. Each call involves a loop of length `L`.
    *   The dominant part of `isValid` is approximately `O(L * 2^L)`. The `L` factor comes from the inner loop that builds `sum` for current segment and also the depth of recursion. The `2^L` factor comes from the branching factor (at each position, we can either end a segment or continue it).
    *   With the pruning `if (sum > target) break;`, the actual operations are significantly fewer than the theoretical `O(L * 2^L)` worst case, as many branches are cut short. However, it's a good upper bound.
*   **Total Time Complexity:** `O(N * L * 2^L)`
    *   Given `N = 1000` and `L = 7`:
    *   `1000 * 7 * 2^7 = 1000 * 7 * 128 = 896,000` operations. This is well within typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second).

#### 4.2. Space Complexity

*   **`punishmentNumber` function:** Uses `O(1)` auxiliary space.
*   **`isValid` function:**
    *   The string `s = to_string(square)` takes `O(L)` space.
    *   The recursion stack depth can go up to `L` (one call for each segment until the end of the string). This takes `O(L)` space.
*   **Total Space Complexity:** `O(L_max)` where `L_max` is the maximum number of digits (7 for `1,000,000`). This is very minimal.

---

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

*   **Smallest `n` (`n = 1`):**
    *   `i = 1`, `square = 1`.
    *   `isValid(1, 1, 1, 0)` is called.
    *   `s = "1"`. `index = 0`.
    *   Loop `i = 0`: `sum = 1`. `target - sum = 0`. Call `isValid(1, 1, 0, 1)`.
    *   Inner `isValid(1, 1, 0, 1)`: `index = 1 == s.size()`. `target == 0` is true. Returns `true`.
    *   Outer `isValid` returns `true`. `sum` accumulates `1*1 = 1`. Correct.

*   **Numbers with '0' digits (e.g., `i = 10`, `square = 100`):**
    *   `isValid(10, 100, 10, 0)` is called.
    *   `s = "100"`.
    *   The function will explore partitions.
    *   One path: Substring "10". `current_val = 10`. `target - current_val = 0`. Recursive call `isValid(10, 100, 0, 2)`.
        *   Inside `isValid(10, 100, 0, 2)`: `index = 2`.
        *   Try substring "0". `current_val = 0`. `target - current_val = 0`. Recursive call `isValid(10, 100, 0, 3)`.
            *   Inside `isValid(10, 100, 0, 3)`: `index = 3 == s.size()`. `target == 0` is true. Returns `true`.
        *   This propagates `true` all the way up.
    *   This correctly handles leading/trailing/middle zeros in substrings. For example, "0" can be a valid partition, as seen in "10 + 0" for 100. "00" could also be a valid partition which evaluates to 0.

*   **Numbers that cannot be partitioned:**
    *   E.g., `i = 2`, `square = 4`.
    *   `isValid(2, 4, 2, 0)`. `s = "4"`.
    *   Loop `i = 0`: `sum = 4`.
    *   `if (sum > target)` (i.e., `4 > 2`) is `true`. `break;`
    *   The loop finishes. No valid partition was found starting from `index=0`. Returns `false`.
    *   This is correctly handled by the `if (sum > target) break;` pruning and the final `return false;`.

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

1.  **Backtracking for Partitioning Problems:** This problem is a classic example of where backtracking (recursive depth-first search) is highly effective. When you need to find if a sequence (like a string of digits) can be broken down into parts that satisfy a certain condition (like summing to a target), consider a recursive function that tries all possible "cuts" or "breaks" at each step.
    *   **Generic Structure:**
        ```

2.  **Pruning for Efficiency:** The `if (sum > target) break;` line is a critical optimization. It significantly reduces the search space by eliminating branches that are guaranteed not to lead to a solution. This technique is fundamental in backtracking and branch-and-bound algorithms. Always look for ways to prune branches early.

3.  **Understanding Constraints:** The `N <= 1000` constraint is key. It indicates that a solution with a polynomial complexity in `N` (e.g., `N log N`, `N^2`, `N^3`) combined with a small constant factor or a small exponential factor for the inner `isValid` check (e.g., `2^L` where `L` is very small) will pass. If `N` were much larger (e.g., `10^5` or `10^6`), this `O(N * L * 2^L)` solution would be too slow, and precomputation or a more mathematically direct approach would be necessary.

4.  **String vs. Integer Manipulation:** For digit-based problems, converting numbers to strings (e.g., `to_string`) is often simpler for iterating through digits and extracting substrings. Be mindful of the overhead of string conversion if it happens frequently in a performance-critical loop, though here it's acceptable.

5.  **Precomputation vs. On-the-Fly Calculation:** For problems with small `N` (maximum input size) and a single query, an on-the-fly calculation per `i` is often sufficient. If there were multiple `punishmentNumber(n)` queries with different `n` values, precomputing all results up to `N_max` would be a significant optimization, turning each query into `O(1)` after an initial setup.
