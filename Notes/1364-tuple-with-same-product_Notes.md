---

## 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to find the number of unique tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that:
1. `a, b, c, d` are all elements from a given array `nums`.
2. `a * b = c * d` (the product of the first two elements equals the product of the last two).
3. `a != b != c != d` (all four elements in the tuple must be distinct).

The input array `nums` consists of `distinct positive integers`.
Constraints:
*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

**Example 1: `nums = [2,3,4,6]`**
*   `2 * 6 = 12`
*   `3 * 4 = 12`
*   Since `2, 3, 4, 6` are all distinct, we have one set of four numbers `{2,3,4,6}` that can form tuples satisfying `a*b=c*d`.
*   The valid pairs are `(2,6)` and `(3,4)`.
*   From these, 8 tuples can be formed: `(2,6,3,4), (2,6,4,3), (6,2,3,4), (6,2,4,3), (3,4,2,6), (4,3,2,6), (3,4,6,2), (4,3,6,2)`.

## 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

### 2.1 Naive Approach (Brute Force)

**Concept:**
The most straightforward way is to iterate through all possible combinations of four distinct elements from `nums` and check if they satisfy the product condition.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize `count = 0`.
2. Use four nested loops to pick four distinct indices `i, j, k, l` from `0` to `n-1` (where `n = len(nums)`). Ensure `i != j != k != l`.
3. Let `a = nums[i]`, `b = nums[j]`, `c = nums[k]`, `d = nums[l]`.
4. Check if `a * b == c * d`.
5. If the condition is met, increment `count`.
6. Return `count`.

**Example Trace (Conceptual for `nums = [2,3,4,6]`):**
*   `i=0 (a=2), j=1 (b=3), k=2 (c=4), l=3 (d=6)`
    *   `a*b = 2*3 = 6`
    *   `c*d = 4*6 = 24`
    *   `6 != 24`. No tuple.
*   ... many iterations ...
*   `i=0 (a=2), j=3 (b=6), k=1 (c=3), l=2 (d=4)`
    *   `a*b = 2*6 = 12`
    *   `c*d = 3*4 = 12`
    *   `12 == 12`. All elements `2,6,3,4` are distinct. Increment `count`.
*   ... continue for all permutations like `(2,6,4,3)`, `(6,2,3,4)`, etc.

**Time Complexity:**
*   `O(N^4)`: Four nested loops, each iterating up to `N` times.
*   Given `N <= 1000`, `1000^4 = 10^12`, which is too slow and would result in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE).

**Space Complexity:**
*   `O(1)`: Only a few variables for `count` and loop indices.

### 2.2 Optimized Approach (Hashing Products)

**Core Idea:**
The condition `a * b = c * d` means we are looking for two *pairs* of numbers `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` such that their products are equal. Since `a, b, c, d` must be distinct, the two pairs themselves must be composed of distinct elements. For example, if `a*b=P` and `c*d=P`, then the set `{a,b}` must be different from `{c,d}`. If they were the same, then `a,b,c,d` wouldn't be distinct. The problem statement guarantees `nums` contains distinct elements, which simplifies this.

**Steps:**
1.  **Generate all unique pairs and their products:**
    *   Iterate through all possible pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `i < j` to avoid duplicate pairs (e.g., `(2,6)` and `(6,2)` are considered the same pair for product calculation).
    *   Calculate the product `P = nums[i] * nums[j]`.
    *   Store the frequency of each product in a hash map (dictionary), say `product_counts`. `product_counts[P]` will store how many distinct pairs result in product `P`.

2.  **Count combinations of pairs:**
    *   Iterate through the `values` (frequencies) in `product_counts`.
    *   For a product `P` that appeared `k` times (i.e., `k` distinct pairs have a product of `P`), we need to choose 2 of these `k` pairs to form `(a,b)` and `(c,d)`. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct pairs from `k` available pairs is given by the combination formula: `C(k, 2) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.
    *   Let `num_pair_combinations` be the sum of `C(k, 2)` for all `k` in `product_counts.values()`.

3.  **Account for permutations within tuples:**
    *   Suppose we picked two distinct pairs `(a,b)` and `(c,d)` such that `a*b = c*d`.
    *   Because `nums` contains distinct elements and we selected two *distinct* pairs (e.g., `{a,b}` is not `{c,d}`), it means `a,b,c,d` will necessarily be four distinct numbers.
    *   For these four numbers, how many tuples `(x,y,z,w)` can be formed such that `x*y = z*w`?
        *   The first pair can be `(a,b)` or `(b,a)` (2 ways).
        *   The second pair can be `(c,d)` or `(d,c)` (2 ways).
        *   The order of the two pairs themselves can be swapped: `(first_pair, second_pair)` or `(second_pair, first_pair)` (2 ways).
        *   Total permutations = `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.
    *   Therefore, the total number of valid tuples is `num_pair_combinations * 8`.

**Time Complexity:**
*   `O(N^2)`:
    *   Generating pairs: Nested loops run `N * (N-1) / 2` times, which is `O(N^2)`.
    *   Dictionary operations (insert/update): On average `O(1)`, so total `O(N^2)`.
    *   Iterating through dictionary values: In the worst case, there can be `O(N^2)` distinct products. Iterating through them is `O(N^2)`.
*   Overall Time: `O(N^2)`. Given `N=1000`, `1000^2 = 10^6`, which is well within typical time limits for competitive programming (usually `10^8` operations per second).

**Space Complexity:**
*   `O(N^2)`: In the worst case, all `N*(N-1)/2` products might be unique. The `product_counts` dictionary would store `O(N^2)` entries.
*   Example: For `N=1000`, `10^6` entries. Each entry stores an integer key and an integer value. This is manageable for memory.

## 3. Detailed Explanation of the Provided Solution Logic

The provided Python solution implements the optimized approach (Hashing Products).

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def tupleSameProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each product from a pair.
        # defaultdict(int) automatically initializes new keys with a default value of 0.
        count = defaultdict(int)
        n = len(nums)

        # Iterate over all unique pairs (i, j) with i < j.
        # This ensures that each pair of distinct numbers (e.g., (2,6)) is considered once,
        # and not twice as (2,6) and (6,2), which produce the same product.
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                prod = nums[i] * nums[j]
                # Increment the count for this product.
                # If 'prod' is encountered for the first time, count[prod] becomes 1.
                # If 'prod' has been seen before, its count is incremented.
                count[prod] += 1

        result = 0
        # For each product that occurs 'v' times, the number of ways to choose two such pairs is:
        # C(v, 2) = v * (v - 1) // 2.
        # This is the number of combinations of selecting 2 distinct pairs from 'v' available pairs
        # that all yield the same product.
        for v in count.values():
            # If v < 2, it means a product was formed by 0 or 1 pair, so no combination of 2 pairs is possible.
            # v * (v - 1) // 2 handles this naturally (results in 0).
            result += v * (v - 1) // 2

        # The problem asks for tuples (a, b, c, d) where a, b, c, d are distinct.
        #
        # Let's say we found two distinct pairs {A, B} and {C, D} such that A*B = C*D.
        # Since all numbers in `nums` are distinct, and we chose two distinct pairs (meaning {A, B} != {C, D}),
        # it inherently means that A, B, C, D are four distinct numbers.
        #
        # For these two sets of numbers, say {A, B} and {C, D}, and their shared product P:
        #
        # 1. The first pair can be (A, B) or (B, A). (2 options)
        # 2. The second pair can be (C, D) or (D, C). (2 options)
        # 3. The roles of the two pairs can be swapped:
        #    - (first pair, second pair) e.g., (A,B,C,D)
        #    - (second pair, first pair) e.g., (C,D,A,B)
        #    (2 options)
        #
        # Total permutations for each combination of two pairs = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
        #
        # Example: nums = [2,3,4,6]
        # Products:
        # 2*3=6, 2*4=8, 2*6=12
        # 3*4=12, 3*6=18
        # 4*6=24
        #
        # count = {6:1, 8:1, 12:2, 18:1, 24:1}
        #
        # Only product 12 has count v=2.
        # result += 2 * (2-1) // 2 = 2 * 1 // 2 = 1.
        #
        # This '1' represents the one combination of two pairs: ({2,6}, {3,4}).
        #
        # Finally, multiply by 8: 1 * 8 = 8.
        # The 8 tuples are:
        # (2,6,3,4), (2,6,4,3), (6,2,3,4), (6,2,4,3)  (when (2,6) is first pair)
        # (3,4,2,6), (4,3,2,6), (3,4,6,2), (4,3,6,2)  (when (3,4) is first pair)
        return result * 8

```

**Alternative Approaches (Variations of Optimized):**

While the provided solution is optimal, one could consider minor variations:

*   **Pre-sorting `nums`**: Not strictly necessary. The current approach works fine without sorting. Sorting might make it easier to reason about pairs, but it doesn't change the complexity of generating products `O(N^2)` or the space `O(N^2)`. It might make the order of pairs consistent, but we are using a hash map anyway, so order doesn't matter for counting.
*   **Two-sum like approach**: If `nums` was small and we could iterate through products, then for a product `P`, find pairs `(x,y)` where `x*y=P`. But products can be very large (`10^4 * 10^4 = 10^8`), so iterating through all possible products is not feasible. The current approach of iterating through numbers and *then* finding products is more efficient.

## 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

**Optimal Approach (Provided Solution)**

*   **Time Complexity:** `O(N^2)`
    *   The dominant part is the nested loop that iterates through all unique pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])`. There are `N * (N - 1) / 2` such pairs, which is `O(N^2)`.
    *   For each pair, calculating the product and updating the `defaultdict` takes `O(1)` on average.
    *   Iterating through the `values()` of the `count` dictionary takes time proportional to the number of distinct products, which can be at most `O(N^2)`.
    *   Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(N^2)`.

*   **Space Complexity:** `O(N^2)`
    *   The `count` dictionary stores the frequency of products.
    *   In the worst case, all `N * (N - 1) / 2` unique pairs could yield distinct products.
    *   Thus, the dictionary could store up to `O(N^2)` entries.
    *   Each key is an integer (product), and each value is an integer (frequency).
    *   This is efficient enough for `N=1000`.

## 5. Edge Cases

1.  **`nums.length < 4`**:
    *   The problem requires a tuple `(a, b, c, d)` where `a, b, c, d` are distinct. If `nums.length` is less than 4, it's impossible to pick four distinct numbers.
    *   **How the solution handles it**:
        *   If `n = len(nums)` is `0, 1, 2, or 3`:
        *   The nested loops `for i in range(n): for j in range(i + 1, n):` will run at most `C(3,2) = 3` times (for `n=3`).
        *   The `count` dictionary will store at most 3 entries, each with a value of 1 (since each pair generates a unique product unless another distinct pair happens to yield the same product, which is unlikely with very small `N`).
        *   When iterating `for v in count.values():`, `v` will be 1 (or 0 if `n<2`).
        *   `v * (v - 1) // 2` will always be `0` for `v=1`.
        *   Therefore, `result` remains `0`, and `0 * 8 = 0` is returned. This is correct as no such tuples can be formed.

2.  **All elements in `nums` are distinct**:
    *   This is a given constraint. It is crucial because it simplifies the problem. If `nums` could contain duplicates, e.g., `nums = [2,2,3,4]`, then `2*2=4` and `1*4=4`. We'd need to be careful about `a!=b!=c!=d`.
    *   **How the solution handles it**:
        *   The distinctness guarantee means that if we find two *different* pairs `{a, b}` and `{c, d}` that produce the same product `P`, then `a, b, c, d` will necessarily be distinct.
        *   Proof: Suppose `a*b = c*d = P`. Assume `{a,b} != {c,d}` (which is what our `C(v,2)` count implies). If `a=c`, then since `a*b=c*d`, we must have `b=d`. This would mean `{a,b} == {c,d}`, which contradicts our assumption that the two chosen pairs were distinct. Thus, `a,b,c,d` must be four distinct values. This validates the `* 8` factor without needing additional checks.

3.  **Positive integers**:
    *   All `nums[i]` are positive. This means all products `nums[i] * nums[j]` will also be positive, avoiding issues with zero or negative products, and ensuring unique products if factors are unique.

## 7. Key Insights and Patterns

1.  **Problem Transformation**: The most critical insight is to rephrase `a * b = c * d` into finding two *pairs* `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` that produce the same product. This changes the problem from finding 4 numbers to finding 2 sets of 2 numbers.

2.  **Hashing/Frequency Counting**: When you need to count occurrences of a derived property (like `product` here), or group elements by a specific characteristic, a hash map (`dict` or `defaultdict` in Python) is an excellent tool. It allows for `O(1)` average time complexity for insertions and lookups.

3.  **Combinatorics (Combinations `C(n, k)` and Permutations)**:
    *   Once you have `v` items (here, `v` pairs) that share a property, and you need to select `k` of them, think about combinations `C(v, k)`. Here, `k=2`.
    *   After selecting the groups, consider the internal arrangements or permutations. The requirement `a != b != c != d` and the definition of a "tuple" means order matters for the final answer. The `* 8` factor accounts for these permutations. This is a common pattern in counting problems where multiple arrangements lead to distinct valid outputs.

4.  **Leveraging Constraints**:
    *   **"Distinct positive integers" in `nums`**: This is a powerful constraint. It simplifies the problem greatly because it ensures that if you pick two *different* pairs (e.g., `{2,6}` and `{3,4}`), the four elements involved (`2,6,3,4`) will automatically be distinct. If `nums` could have duplicates, or if elements could be zero or negative, the logic for ensuring `a != b != c != d` would be significantly more complex.
    *   **`N <= 1000`**: This constraint immediately suggests that `O(N^2)` solutions are likely acceptable, while `O(N^3)` or `O(N^4)` would be too slow. This guides the choice away from naive brute force.

5.  **Pairwise Iteration**: Many array problems involve finding relationships between pairs of elements. A common pattern is to use nested loops (like `for i in range(n): for j in range(i+1, n):`) to efficiently generate all unique pairs.

This problem is a good example of how to break down a seemingly complex counting problem into simpler steps involving frequency counting and combinatorics, heavily relying on the problem's constraints.
