This problem asks us to repeatedly remove the **leftmost** occurrence of a given `part` string from `s` until no occurrences of `part` remain. The key challenge is that removing a substring can create new opportunities for `part` to appear.

---

### 1. Problem Summary

We are given two strings, `s` (the main string) and `part` (the substring to be removed). The goal is to modify `s` by repeatedly finding and removing the **leftmost** occurrence of `part`. This process continues until `part` no longer exists anywhere in `s`. The final modified `s` is returned.

**Example Illustration**:
If `s = "daabcbaabcbc"` and `part = "abc"`:
1. `s = "da**abc**baabcbc"` -> `s = "dabaabcbc"` (removed at index 2)
2. `s = "daba**abc**bc"` -> `s = "dababc"` (removed at index 4)
3. `s = "dab**abc**"` -> `s = "dab"` (removed at index 3)
No more "abc" in "dab". Return "dab".

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

#### A. Naive/Direct Simulation Approach

This approach directly simulates the operations described in the problem statement.
1. Repeatedly search for `part` in `s` from the beginning.
2. If `part` is found, remove it from `s`.
3. If `part` is not found, stop.

**Implementation Details**:
Most string libraries provide functions like `find` (to locate a substring) and `erase` (to remove a portion of a string). We would use these functions in a loop.

**Pros**:
*   Straightforward to understand and implement, closely follows the problem description.

**Cons**:
*   Potentially very inefficient. `string::find` can take O(N*M) in the worst case (where N is `s.length()` and M is `part.length()`). `string::erase` can take O(N) because it might involve shifting all subsequent characters.
*   In the worst case, if `s` is very long and `part` is short, and each removal exposes a new `part` such that many removals are needed (e.g., `s = "aaaaa"`, `part = "aa"`), the total operations could be `O(N)` removals, each taking `O(N*M)` for `find` and `O(N)` for `erase`. This leads to a total time complexity of `O(N * (NM + N)) = O(N^2 * M)`. Given N, M up to 1000, `1000^3 = 10^9` operations would be too slow.

#### B. Optimized Approach: Using a Dynamic String/Stack-like Structure

This is the approach taken by the provided solution and is generally more efficient. Instead of modifying the original string in place (which involves costly reallocations and character shifts), we build a *new* string (let's call it `result`) character by character.

**Core Idea**:
When we append a character `c` from `s` to our `result` string, we immediately check if the *end* of `result` now forms the `part` string. If it does, we remove `part` from the end of `result`. This "stack-like" behavior is crucial because removing characters from the end of `result` might expose previously appended characters that now form a new `part` with even earlier characters.

**Example**: `s = "axxxxyyyyb"`, `part = "xy"`
1. `result = ""`
2. Read 'a': `result = "a"`
3. Read 'x': `result = "ax"`
4. Read 'x': `result = "axx"`
5. Read 'x': `result = "axxx"`
6. Read 'x': `result = "axxxx"`
7. Read 'y': `result = "axxxy"` (no match)
8. Read 'y': `result = "axxxyy"` (no match)
9. Read 'y': `result = "axxxyyy"` (no match)
10. Read 'y': `result = "axxxyyyy"` (no match)
11. Read 'b': `result = "axxxyyyyb"` (no match)

Wait, this example does not demonstrate the key insight correctly. The problem states "remove the leftmost". The stack-like behavior handles this automatically. Let's trace it carefully with the example given in the problem: `s = "axxxxyyyyb"`, `part = "xy"`

1.  `result = ""`
2.  `c = 'a'`: `result = "a"`
3.  `c = 'x'`: `result = "ax"`
4.  `c = 'x'`: `result = "axx"`
5.  `c = 'x'`: `result = "axxx"`
6.  `c = 'x'`: `result = "axxxx"`
7.  `c = 'y'`: `result = "axxxxy"`
    *   Check `result.size() >= pLen` (6 >= 2 is true)
    *   Check `result`'s end: `"xy"` matches `part`.
    *   Remove `"xy"` from `result`: `result = "axxx"`.
8.  `c = 'y'`: `result = "axxxy"`
    *   Check `result.size() >= pLen` (5 >= 2 is true)
    *   Check `result`'s end: `"xy"` matches `part`.
    *   Remove `"xy"` from `result`: `result = "axx"`.
9.  `c = 'y'`: `result = "axxy"`
    *   Check `result.size() >= pLen` (4 >= 2 is true)
    *   Check `result`'s end: `"xy"` matches `part`.
    *   Remove `"xy"` from `result`: `result = "ax"`.
10. `c = 'y'`: `result = "axy"`
    *   Check `result.size() >= pLen` (3 >= 2 is true)
    *   Check `result`'s end: `"xy"` matches `part`.
    *   Remove `"xy"` from `result`: `result = "a"`.
11. `c = 'b'`: `result = "ab"`
    *   Check `result.size() >= pLen` (2 >= 2 is true)
    *   Check `result`'s end: `"ab"` does *not* match `part`.
    *   No removal.

Final `result = "ab"`. This trace *exactly* matches the example output and illustrates how the stack-like behavior correctly handles the "leftmost" removal indirectly by prioritizing new matches formed at the current "active" end of the string.

**Pros**:
*   More efficient as it avoids repeated full string scans and large character shifts.
*   Handles the cascading removal effect naturally.

**Cons**:
*   Requires building a new string, potentially consuming O(N) space.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Logic Behind the Provided Solution

The provided solution implements the optimized approach using a dynamic string (which effectively acts like a stack).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeOccurrences(string s, string part) {
        int pLen = part.size(); // Store the length of the part string for efficiency.
        string result; // This string will store the modified characters.
                        // It effectively acts like a stack where we push chars
                        // and conditionally pop the 'part' substring.

        // Iterate through each character of the input string 's'.
        for (char c : s) {
            result.push_back(c); // Append the current character 'c' to our 'result' string.
                                 // This is like pushing onto a stack.

            // After appending 'c', we check if the 'result' string
            // now ends with the 'part' substring.
            // We only need to check if 'result' is at least as long as 'part'.
            if (result.size() >= pLen) {
                // Check if the last 'pLen' characters of 'result' match 'part'.
                // string::compare(pos, len, other_string) compares 'len' characters
                // of 'this' string starting from 'pos' with 'other_string'.
                // It returns 0 if they are equal.
                if (result.compare(result.size() - pLen, pLen, part) == 0) {
                    // If a match is found, remove 'pLen' characters from the end of 'result'.
                    // string::erase(pos, len) removes 'len' characters starting from 'pos'.
                    result.erase(result.size() - pLen, pLen);
                }
            }
        }
        // After processing all characters from 's', 'result' will contain
        // the string with all occurrences of 'part' removed according to the rules.
        return result;
    }
};
```

**Why this approach correctly handles "leftmost"**:
The problem states "find the leftmost occurrence ... and remove it". The stack-like approach processes the input string `s` from left to right. When it finds a match for `part` at the *end* of the `result` string, it effectively means that this `part` occurrence is formed by characters that were added most recently. If this `part` is removed, any *new* `part` that might be formed due to this removal will also appear at the new end of the `result` string and be handled immediately. This ensures that `part` occurrences that are *currently visible and formable* at the "active" end of the string are dealt with first. Because we are appending characters from left to right, any `part` that would have existed entirely to the left of the current `result` (i.e., not involving newly appended characters) would have already been processed and removed. Thus, the current check for `part` at the end of `result` effectively represents the "leftmost" *removable* instance in the continuously shrinking/growing string.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

#### A. Naive/Direct Simulation Approach (`string::find` and `string::erase` in a loop)

*   **Time Complexity**: `O(N^2 * M)` in the worst case.
    *   Let `N` be `s.length()` and `M` be `part.length()`.
    *   The `while` loop can run up to `N` times (e.g., removing one character at a time, like "aaaa", "aa").
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `s.find(part)`: In the worst case, this can take `O(N * M)`.
        *   `s.erase(pos, M)`: This operation can take `O(N)` because characters after `pos + M` need to be shifted left.
    *   Total: `N * (N*M + N)` = `O(N^2 * M)`.
    *   Given constraints `N, M <= 1000`, `1000^3 = 10^9` operations would be too slow.

*   **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`
    *   `std::string::erase` in C++ generally modifies the string in-place. However, depending on implementations and reallocations, temporary space might be used. Conceptually, the string itself occupies `O(N)` space.

#### B. Optimized Approach (Provided Solution: Dynamic String/Stack-like)

*   **Time Complexity**: `O(N * M)`
    *   `N` iterations, one for each character in the input string `s`.
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `result.push_back(c)`: Amortized `O(1)`. If reallocation is needed, it might take `O(current_result_size)`, but this is amortized over many pushes.
        *   `result.size()`: `O(1)`.
        *   `result.compare(result.size() - pLen, pLen, part)`: Compares `pLen` characters. This takes `O(M)`.
        *   `result.erase(result.size() - pLen, pLen)`: Removes `pLen` characters from the end. In `std::string`, `erase` at the end of the string is efficient, often `O(M)` (as it adjusts the length and doesn't need to shift characters).
    *   Since the `compare` and `erase` operations within the loop each take `O(M)` time, and they occur for each of the `N` input characters, the total time complexity is `O(N * M)`.
    *   Given constraints `N, M <= 1000`, `1000 * 1000 = 10^6` operations are well within typical time limits.

*   **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`
    *   The `result` string can grow up to the original length of `s` in the worst case (e.g., if `part` never matches, `result` becomes `s`).

---

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

*   **`s` is empty or `part` is empty**:
    *   The constraints state `1 <= s.length <= 1000` and `1 <= part.length <= 1000`. So, `s` and `part` will never be empty according to the problem constraints.
*   **`part` is longer than `s` initially**:
    *   Example: `s = "abc"`, `part = "abcd"`.
    *   The `result.size() >= pLen` check handles this. `result` will never reach the length of `part`, so the `compare` and `erase` operations will never be called. `result` will simply become `s`, and `s` will be returned, which is correct as no `part` can be found.
*   **`part` does not appear in `s`**:
    *   Example: `s = "hello"`, `part = "xyz"`.
    *   The `if (result.size() >= pLen && ...)` condition will never be true because `part` will never match the end of `result`. `result` will accumulate all characters of `s` and then `s` will be returned, which is correct.
*   **`s` consists entirely of `part` repeated**:
    *   Example: `s = "abcabcabc"`, `part = "abc"`.
    *   `result` after 'a': "a"
    *   `result` after 'b': "ab"
    *   `result` after 'c': "abc" -> matches "abc", remove -> `result` = ""
    *   `result` after 'a': "a"
    *   `result` after 'b': "ab"
    *   `result` after 'c': "abc" -> matches "abc", remove -> `result` = ""
    *   And so on. The final `result` will be an empty string, which is correct.
*   **Removals creating new matches (cascading effect)**:
    *   Example: `s = "abccba"`, `part = "bc"`.
    *   1. 'a': `result = "a"`
    *   2. 'b': `result = "ab"`
    *   3. 'c': `result = "abc"`
    *   4. 'c': `result = "abcc"`. Now, `result.size() - pLen` (4-2=2) to `pLen` (2) is "cc". Does not match "bc".
    *   5. 'b': `result = "abccb"`. Now, `result.size() - pLen` (5-2=3) to `pLen` (2) is "cb". Does not match "bc".
    *   6. 'a': `result = "abccba"`. Now, `result.size() - pLen` (6-2=4) to `pLen` (2) is "ba". Does not match "bc".
    *   This is an example where the direct simulation `s.find/erase` would be needed because the "bc" in "ab**cb**a" is formed from non-adjacent characters after deletion.
    *   Ah, my trace earlier for `axxxxyyyyb` correctly handled this. Let's re-verify `abccba`, `part = "bc"`.
        `s = "abccba"`, `part = "bc"`
        1. `c = 'a'`: `result = "a"`
        2. `c = 'b'`: `result = "ab"`
        3. `c = 'c'`: `result = "abc"`
            * `result.size()=3 >= 2`. `result[1..2]` is "bc". Match!
            * `result.erase(1, 2)`: `result = "a"`
        4. `c = 'c'`: `result = "ac"`
        5. `c = 'b'`: `result = "acb"`
        6. `c = 'a'`: `result = "acba"`
        Final `result = "acba"`. This correctly handles "leftmost" effectively. The problem means "leftmost *in the currently modified string*". The stack-like approach naturally maintains the current state of the modified string and always checks the *end* of it, which corresponds to the "rightmost newly formed sequence" but due to its nature, it also indirectly covers the leftmost if a removal causes a new leftmost one to emerge from previously distinct parts.

```cpp
#include <string> // Required for string manipulation
#include <vector> // Not strictly needed for this solution but often useful

class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * Removes all occurrences of a given substring 'part' from 's' according

    std::string removeOccurrences(std::string s, std::string part) {
        // Store the length of 'part' for frequent access, improving readability and minor optimization.
        int pLen = part.size();

        // 'result' will store the characters of 's' that remain after removals.
        // It acts like a stack where characters are pushed, and 'part' is "popped"
        // if it forms at the end of the string.

            // This is analogous to pushing 'c' onto a stack.
            result.push_back(c);

            // After adding a character, check if the end of 'result' now forms 'part'.
            // This check is only relevant if 'result' is at least as long as 'part'.
            if (result.size() >= pLen) {
                // Check if the substring of 'result' of length 'pLen'
                // ending at 'result.size() - 1' (i.e., starting at 'result.size() - pLen')
                // is equal to 'part'.
                // std::string::compare returns 0 if the substrings are identical.
                if (result.compare(result.size() - pLen, pLen, part) == 0) {
                    // If 'part' is found at the end of 'result', remove it.
                    // This is analogous to popping 'pLen' characters from the stack.
                    // std::string::erase(position, count) removes 'count' characters
                    // starting from 'position'.
                    result.erase(result.size() - pLen, pLen);
                }
            }
        }

        // After processing all characters from 's', the 'result' string
        // will contain the final state with all specified occurrences of 'part' removed.
        return result;
    }
};

```

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns That Can Be Applied to Similar Problems

1.  **Stack/Dynamic String for Sequential Processing with Backtracking/Removal**:
    *   This is the most crucial pattern demonstrated. When you process a sequence (like a string or an array) character by character (or element by element) from left to right, and the removal or modification of an element can affect *previously processed* elements (e.g., by creating new matches or adjacent duplicates), a stack or a dynamic string (acting like a stack) is often the optimal data structure.
    *   **How it works**: You build a new result string/stack. For each incoming element, you add it to the result. Then, you check a condition involving the *last few* elements of the result. If the condition is met, you remove elements from the end of the result. This effectively "backtracks" and re-evaluates the string's state.
    *   **Similar Problems**:
        *   "Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String" (LeetCode 1047): Similar logic, check if `result` ends with the same character as the new one.
        *   "Decode String" (LeetCode 394): Involves nested structures and processing tokens in order, sometimes pushing to a stack and sometimes popping.
        *   "Simplify Path" (LeetCode 71): Processing directory components, using a stack to handle '..' and '.' entries.
        *   Problems involving parentheses/bracket balancing where `()` or `[]` pairs are removed.

2.  **Efficiency of String Operations**:
    *   In C++ `std::string`, `find`, `erase`, `insert` operations (especially in the middle or beginning of a large string) can be expensive (`O(N)` or `O(N*M)`) because they might involve shifting many characters.
    *   Building a new string using `push_back` (amortized `O(1)`) and `pop_back` / `erase` from the end (`O(M)`) is often significantly more efficient than repeated `find` and `erase` operations on the original string, especially when many removals are expected.
    *   Be mindful of string immutability in other languages (e.g., Python). There, string operations *always* create new strings, but optimized built-in methods might still perform better than naive loop implementations.

3.  **Greedy Approach with Local Optimization**:
    *   The solution essentially applies a greedy strategy: whenever `part` can be formed at the end of the `result` string, it is immediately removed. This local optimization (removing the current match) contributes to the global goal (removing all matches). The stack-like behavior ensures that this greedy local removal doesn't prevent finding other matches (it actually helps expose them).

These patterns are highly useful for problems involving sequence transformations, especially when deletions or changes at one point can influence subsequent or preceding parts of the sequence.
