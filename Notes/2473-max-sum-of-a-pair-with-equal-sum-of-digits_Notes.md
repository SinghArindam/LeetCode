### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to find the maximum possible sum of two distinct numbers `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` from a given array `nums`, such that the sum of digits of `nums[i]` is equal to the sum of digits of `nums[j]`. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.

**Input:**
*   A `0-indexed` array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

**Conditions for a valid pair (i, j):**
*   `i != j` (indices must be distinct)
*   `sum_of_digits(nums[i]) == sum_of_digits(nums[j])`

**Output:**
*   The maximum value of `nums[i] + nums[j]` among all valid pairs.
*   Return `-1` if no such pair exists.

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` (Array size)
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9` (Value of elements)

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

#### 2.1. Naive Approach: Brute Force

**Idea:** Iterate through all possible pairs of distinct indices `(i, j)` in the `nums` array. For each pair, calculate the sum of digits for both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. If their digit sums are equal, update the maximum sum found so far.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize `max_sum = -1`.
2. Implement a helper function `calculateDigitSum(int num)` that returns the sum of digits of `num`.
3. Use nested loops to iterate through all unique pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.
4. For each pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`:
    a. Calculate `s_i = calculateDigitSum(nums[i])`.
    b. Calculate `s_j = calculateDigitSum(nums[j])`.
    c. If `s_i == s_j`, then `max_sum = max(max_sum, nums[i] + nums[j])`.
5. Return `max_sum`.

**Example Trace (Conceptual):**
`nums = [18, 43, 36, 13, 7]`
*   Pairs: `(18, 43)`: sum_digits(18)=9, sum_digits(43)=7. Not equal.
*   Pairs: `(18, 36)`: sum_digits(18)=9, sum_digits(36)=9. Equal! `max_sum = max(-1, 18+36) = 54`.
*   ... (continue for all pairs)
*   Pairs: `(43, 7)`: sum_digits(43)=7, sum_digits(7)=7. Equal! `max_sum = max(54, 43+7) = 54`.

#### 2.2. Optimized Approach: Hashing/Grouping

**Idea:** The problem requires finding numbers with *equal* digit sums. This suggests grouping numbers by their digit sum. Once grouped, for any group that has two or more numbers, we want to pick the two largest numbers from that group to maximize their sum.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize `max_sum = -1`.
2. Implement a helper function `calculateDigitSum(int num)`.
3. Create a hash map (e.g., `std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>>` in C++, or `Map<Integer, List<Integer>>` in Java) where:
    *   Keys are digit sums.
    *   Values are lists of numbers that have that specific digit sum.
4. **Populate the map:** Iterate through each `num` in the input `nums` array:
    a. Calculate `s = calculateDigitSum(num)`.
    b. Add `num` to the list associated with key `s` in the map.
5. **Process the map:** Iterate through each entry (key-value pair) in the hash map:
    a. Get the list of numbers associated with the current digit sum.
    b. If the list contains fewer than two numbers, skip it (no pair can be formed).
    c. If the list contains two or more numbers:
        i. Sort the list in descending order.
        ii. Take the first two elements (which will be the two largest) and calculate their sum.
        iii. Update `max_sum = max(max_sum, sum_of_two_largest)`.
6. Return `max_sum`.

**Refinement for Optimized Approach (as seen in the provided solution):**
Instead of storing a `std::vector<int>` for each digit sum and then sorting it, we only need the *two largest* numbers for any given digit sum. We can maintain these two largest numbers directly in the map's value.

**Refined Steps (The Provided Solution's Logic):**
1. Initialize `max_sum = -1`.
2. Implement a helper function `calculateDigitSum(int num)`.
3. Create a hash map (`std::unordered_map<int, std::pair<int, int>>` in C++) where:
    *   Keys are digit sums.
    *   Values are `std::pair<int, int>`, representing `(largest_num, second_largest_num)` found so far for that digit sum. Initialize values for new keys to `(0, 0)` (since `nums[i]` are positive, 0 acts as a sentinel for "not found").
4. **Populate the map:** Iterate through each `num` in the input `nums` array:
    a. Calculate `s = calculateDigitSum(num)`.
    b. Get a reference to the pair `p = mp[s]`.
    c. Update `p` with `num`:
        *   If `num > p.first` (current `num` is greater than the current largest):
            *   `p.second = p.first` (old largest becomes new second largest).
            *   `p.first = num` (current `num` becomes new largest).
        *   Else if `num > p.second` (current `num` is not largest, but is greater than second largest):
            *   `p.second = num` (current `num` becomes new second largest).
5. **Process the map:** Iterate through each `(digit_sum, pair_of_numbers)` entry in the hash map:
    a. Let `p = pair_of_numbers`.
    b. If `p.second != 0` (this means we have found at least two positive numbers for this digit sum):
        *   `max_sum = max(max_sum, p.first + p.second)`.
6. Return `max_sum`.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of the Provided Solution Logic

The provided solution implements the refined optimized approach using an `unordered_map` to store the two largest numbers for each digit sum encountered.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        // 1. Lambda function to compute the sum of digits for a given number.
        // This function is efficient, taking logarithmic time with respect to the number's value.
        auto digitSum = [](int num) {
            int s = 0;
            while (num > 0) {
                s += num % 10; // Add the last digit to the sum
                num /= 10;     // Remove the last digit
            }
            return s;
        };
        
        // 2. Data structure to store numbers grouped by their digit sum.
        // unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> mp;
        // Key: The digit sum (int).
        // Value: A pair<int, int> representing (largest_number, second_largest_number)
        //        found so far for that specific digit sum.
        //        Initial values for new entries will be (0, 0) since `int` defaults to 0.
        //        This works because all nums[i] are positive (>= 1).
        unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> mp;
        
        // 3. Initialize the answer. -1 is used as per problem statement for no valid pair.
        int ans = -1;
        
        // 4. First Pass: Populate the map with the largest and second largest numbers for each digit sum.
        for (int num : nums) {
            int s = digitSum(num); // Calculate digit sum for the current number
            
            // Get a reference to the pair associated with this digit sum 's'.
            // If 's' is not yet in the map, a new entry (s, {0,0}) is created.
            auto &p = mp[s]; 
            
            // Update the pair (p.first, p.second) based on the current 'num':
            // We want p.first to always hold the largest number and p.second the second largest.
            if (num > p.first) {
                // If 'num' is greater than the current largest (p.first):
                // The old largest (p.first) now becomes the second largest.
                p.second = p.first; 
                // 'num' becomes the new largest.
                p.first = num;
            } else if (num > p.second) {
                // If 'num' is not greater than the current largest (p.first),
                // but is greater than the current second largest (p.second):
                // 'num' becomes the new second largest.
                p.second = num;
            }
            // If 'num' is smaller than or equal to p.second, it's not among the top two, so we ignore it.
            // Duplicate numbers are handled correctly: if nums = [18, 18, 36]
            // - For first 18: mp[9] = {18, 0}
            // - For second 18: num (18) is not > p.first (18), but num (18) is > p.second (0). So mp[9] = {18, 18}.
            // - For 36: num (36) is > p.first (18). So p.second becomes 18, p.first becomes 36. mp[9] = {36, 18}.
            // This correctly captures the two largest values even if they are duplicates of original values.
        }
        
        // 5. Second Pass: Iterate through the populated map to find the maximum sum.
        // We look for groups that successfully found at least two numbers.
        for (auto &kv : mp) {
            auto p = kv.second; // Get the (largest, second_largest) pair for the current digit sum.
            
            // A valid pair exists if and only if p.second is not 0.
            // Since all numbers in `nums` are positive (>=1), if p.second is 0,
            // it implies that either:
            // a) Only one number was found for this digit sum (p.first holds that number, p.second is still 0).
            // b) No numbers were found for this digit sum (though this branch of the map loop wouldn't be entered for such a case).
            if (p.second != 0) { 
                // If a second largest number (which must be positive) exists, 
                // it means we have at least two numbers for this digit sum.
                ans = max(ans, p.first + p.second); // Update global maximum sum.
            }
        }
        
        // 6. Return the final maximum sum.
        return ans;
    }
};
```

**Alternative Logic (using `std::vector` as map value):**
This approach is conceptually similar but less optimized for the specific requirement of just two largest values.

1.  `unordered_map<int, vector<int>> mp;`
2.  Populate `mp` by pushing `num` into `mp[s]`'s vector.
3.  After populating:
    ```cpp
    for (auto &kv : mp) {
        vector<int>& numbers = kv.second;
        if (numbers.size() >= 2) {
            // Sort in descending order to easily get the two largest
            sort(numbers.rbegin(), numbers.rend()); 
            ans = max(ans, numbers[0] + numbers[1]);
        }
    }
    ```
This alternative is simpler to write if sorting `std::vector` is allowed, but it has a higher worst-case time complexity, as discussed in the next section.

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

#### 4.1. Naive Approach (Brute Force)

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Outer loop runs `N` times. Inner loop runs `N` times.
    *   `calculateDigitSum(num)` takes `O(D)` time, where `D` is the number of digits in `num`. For `num <= 10^9`, `D` is at most 10. So `D` is roughly `log10(max_num_val)`.
    *   Total time: `O(N^2 * D)`.
    *   Given `N = 10^5`, `N^2 = 10^{10}`, which is far too slow for typical time limits (usually around `10^8` operations).
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (excluding input array storage).

#### 4.2. Optimized Approach (Provided Solution)

*   **`calculateDigitSum` function:** Takes `O(D)` time, where `D` is the number of digits in `num`. Since `num <= 10^9`, `D` is at most 10 (for `999,999,999`).
*   **First Pass (Populating the map):**
    *   Iterates `N` times (for each `num` in `nums`).
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `digitSum(num)`: `O(D)`.
        *   `unordered_map` operations (insertion, access, update): Average `O(1)`. Worst-case `O(K)` where `K` is number of elements in a bucket, though this is rare with a good hash function and not usually considered for average complexity analysis of hash maps.
    *   Total for first pass: `O(N * D)`.
*   **Second Pass (Processing the map):**
    *   Iterates over the unique digit sums stored in the map.
    *   The maximum possible digit sum for a number up to `10^9` (i.e., `999,999,999`) is `9 * 9 = 81`. So there are at most `~82` unique digit sums possible (from 1 to 81, or 0 if 0 was allowed in input).
    *   Let `M_DS` be the maximum possible digit sum. `M_DS` is a small constant (~82).
    *   The loop runs `O(M_DS)` times. Inside the loop, operations are `O(1)`.
    *   Total for second pass: `O(M_DS)`.
*   **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(N * D + M_DS)`. Since `N=10^5` and `D=10`, `N*D` is `10^6`. `M_DS` is negligible compared to `N*D`. Thus, the dominant factor is `O(N * D)`. This is efficient enough.
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(M_DS)` for the `unordered_map`. Since `M_DS` is a small constant (~82), the space used by the map itself does not grow with `N`. We can consider this `O(1)` space for the map structure, though technically it's `O(max_possible_digit_sum)`. This is highly efficient.

#### 4.3. Alternative Approach (using `std::vector` in map value)

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   First Pass (Populating map): `O(N * D)` (same as above).
    *   Second Pass (Processing map):
        *   Iterates `O(M_DS)` times.
        *   Inside the loop, `sort(numbers.rbegin(), numbers.rend())` for each vector. If a vector has `L` elements, sorting takes `O(L log L)`. In the worst case, all `N` numbers could have the same digit sum, making one vector of size `N`.
        *   So, worst-case for second pass: `O(N log N)`.
    *   Overall Time Complexity: `O(N * D + N log N)`. This is less efficient than `O(N * D)` of the provided solution, but still acceptable for `N=10^5` (`10^5 * log(10^5)` is roughly `10^5 * 17`, which is `1.7 * 10^6`).
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` in the worst case, if all numbers have the same digit sum, then one `vector` in the map will store all `N` numbers. This is acceptable for `N=10^5`.

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

1.  **No pairs found that satisfy the condition (equal digit sum):**
    *   **Handling:** The `ans` variable is initialized to `-1`. If, after iterating through all numbers and map entries, no `p.second != 0` condition is met for any digit sum, `ans` will remain `-1`, which is correctly returned.
    *   Example: `nums = [10, 12, 19, 14]`
        *   `digitSum(10)=1`, `digitSum(12)=3`, `digitSum(19)=10`, `digitSum(14)=5`.
        *   Each number has a unique digit sum. No `mp` entry will ever have `p.second != 0`. `ans` remains `-1`.

2.  **Only one number exists for a particular digit sum:**
    *   **Handling:** When a digit sum `s` is encountered for the very first time with `num`, `mp[s]` becomes `{num, 0}`. If no other number with the same digit sum `s` is found, `p.second` for this `s` remains `0`. The check `if (p.second != 0)` correctly filters out these cases, ensuring only groups with at least two numbers contribute to `ans`.
    *   Example: `nums = [18, 43]`
        *   `mp[9] = {18, 0}`
        *   `mp[7] = {43, 0}`
        *   Neither `mp[9].second` nor `mp[7].second` is non-zero, so `ans` remains `-1`.

3.  **`nums` contains duplicate values:**
    *   **Handling:** The solution correctly handles duplicates. For instance, if `nums = [18, 18, 36]`:
        *   `digitSum(18) = 9`, `digitSum(36) = 9`.
        *   Processing `18` (first): `mp[9]` becomes `{18, 0}`.
        *   Processing `18` (second): `num=18`. `18` is not `> mp[9].first (18)`, but `18` *is* `> mp[9].second (0)`. So `mp[9].second` becomes `18`. `mp[9]` is now `{18, 18}`.
        *   Processing `36`: `num=36`. `36` *is* `> mp[9].first (18)`. So `mp[9].second` takes the value of old `mp[9].first` (`18`), and `mp[9].first` becomes `36`. `mp[9]` is now `{36, 18}`.
        *   Finally, `p.first + p.second = 36 + 18 = 54`, which is correct. The logic correctly finds the *two largest values* among all numbers sharing the same digit sum, regardless of their original indices or if they are duplicates of each other.

4.  **Constraints adherence (`1 <= nums[i]`, `nums.length >= 1`):**
    *   `nums[i]` are positive: This is crucial for using `0` as a sentinel value in the `pair<int, int>` to indicate an uninitialized or single-element group. If `0` were allowed in `nums`, this logic would need adjustment.
    *   `nums.length >= 1`: If `nums.length` was 0, an empty array would need to be handled, but the constraint ensures at least one element. If `nums.length` is 1, no pair `(i, j)` with `i != j` can be formed, so `ans` correctly remains `-1`.

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns Applicable to Similar Problems

1.  **Grouping by a Derived Property (Hashing):** When a problem requires finding elements that share a common property (which might not be directly available in the input but can be computed from each element), using a hash map (or dictionary) is a highly effective strategy. The common property (e.g., digit sum, sum of factors, specific bit pattern, prime factorization hash) becomes the key, and a list/set/pair of elements sharing that property becomes the value.
    *   **Applicability:** Problems like "Group Anagrams", "Find Duplicates in an Array", "Count Pairs with a Given Sum" (where the 'sum' is a property of the numbers themselves, not their sum).

2.  **Efficiently Finding Top K Elements:** When you need the top `K` (e.g., largest, smallest) elements from a collection of items that belong to different groups, avoid sorting entire lists if `K` is very small.
    *   For `K=1` (e.g., "Max element with property X"), just store the max.
    *   For `K=2` (as in this problem), two variables (`first_largest`, `second_largest`) are sufficient and efficient.
    *   For larger `K`, a min-heap (or max-heap depending on what you're tracking) of size `K` is a common pattern.
    *   **Applicability:** Problems asking for "Kth largest element", "sum of top 3 scores", "pairs with max/min product".

3.  **Digit Manipulation:** Calculating the sum of digits, product of digits, reversing digits, or checking for specific digit patterns (`num % 10`, `num /= 10`) is a common technique in number theory problems. It's an `O(log N)` operation.
    *   **Applicability:** Problems involving numerical properties, base conversions, digital roots, or numbers with specific digit structures.

4.  **Sentinel Values for Initialization and Edge Cases:** Using a specific value (like -1 for "no pair found" or 0 for "not yet found a positive number") is crucial for correct initialization and handling edge cases where no valid results might be generated. This avoids complex conditional logic.
    *   **Applicability:** Problems finding min/max values, counting occurrences, or where a "no result" state needs to be explicitly represented.

5.  **Read Constraints Carefully:** The constraints on `N` and `nums[i]` dictate the feasible time and space complexity. `N=10^5` immediately rules out `O(N^2)` solutions, pushing towards `O(N log N)` or `O(N)`. The `nums[i]` range affects the `D` (number of digits) for digit sum calculations and the range of possible digit sums (determining `M_DS`).

By internalizing these patterns, similar problems can often be approached with a structured and optimized mindset.
