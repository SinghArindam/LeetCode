The following notes provide a comprehensive analysis of LeetCode problem 3309, "Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs I".

---

### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks us to count specific pairs of strings from a given `0-indexed` array called `words`. We are provided with a boolean function `isPrefixAndSuffix(str1, str2)`, which returns `true` if `str1` is **both** a prefix and a suffix of `str2`, and `false` otherwise. Our task is to return the total number of index pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j])` evaluates to `true`.

**Key points from the problem statement:**
*   Input: `words`, a `std::vector<std::string>`.
*   Condition for counting: `i < j` AND `words[i]` is a prefix of `words[j]` AND `words[i]` is a suffix of `words[j]`.
*   Constraints:
    *   `1 <= words.length <= 50` (N)
    *   `1 <= words[i].length <= 10` (L)
    *   `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

### 2. Explanation of All Possible Approaches

#### 2.1 Naive (Brute-Force) Approach

**Concept:**
The most straightforward approach is to iterate through all possible unique pairs `(words[i], words[j])` where `i < j` and, for each pair, directly apply the `isPrefixAndSuffix` check as defined.

**Steps:**
1.  Initialize a counter variable, say `count`, to 0.
2.  Use a nested loop structure to iterate through all possible pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j`:
    *   The outer loop iterates with index `i` from `0` to `words.size() - 1`.
    *   The inner loop iterates with index `j` from `i + 1` to `words.size() - 1`. This ensures `i < j` and that each pair is considered exactly once.
3.  Inside the inner loop, for the current pair `(words[i], words[j])`:
    *   Let `str1 = words[i]` and `str2 = words[j]`.
    *   First, check if `str1.size() > str2.size()`. If true, `str1` cannot be a prefix or suffix of `str2`, so move to the next pair.
    *   Otherwise, check if `str1` is a prefix of `str2`. This can be done by comparing `str1` with `str2.substr(0, str1.size())`.
    *   Concurrently, check if `str1` is a suffix of `str2`. This can be done by comparing `str1` with `str2.substr(str2.size() - str1.size())`.
    *   If both the prefix and suffix conditions are true, increment `count`.
4.  After checking all pairs, return `count`.

#### 2.2 Optimized Approaches

Given the extremely small constraints (`words.length <= 50`, `words[i].length <= 10`), the brute-force approach is highly efficient in practice and runs well within typical time limits. There are no common algorithmic paradigms (like Tries, hashing, or advanced string matching algorithms) that would yield a significant practical performance improvement for *this specific problem* under these tight constraints. Any more complex data structure or algorithm would likely introduce overhead that outweighs any theoretical benefit.

For example, a Trie-based approach could theoretically improve prefix searching, but checking `i < j` and *both* prefix and suffix conditions for all pairs would still involve complex traversals or additional data structures (like a suffix Trie or storing reversed strings), ultimately leading to a solution that is harder to implement and likely slower for these small constraints.

Therefore, the brute-force approach is considered the *optimal practical solution* for the given constraints.

### 3. Detailed Explanation of Logic

#### 3.1 Logic Behind the Provided Solution (Brute-Force)

The provided C++ solution directly implements the naive brute-force approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrefixSuffixPairs(vector<string>& words) {
        int ctr = 0; // Initialize counter for valid pairs
        
        // Outer loop: Iterate through each word as the potential 'prefix/suffix' string (words[i])
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            // Inner loop: Iterate through each subsequent word as the potential 'target' string (words[j])
            // Starting 'j' from 'i + 1' ensures 'i < j' and avoids duplicate pairs (e.g., (1,0) after (0,1))
            for (int j = i + 1; j < words.size(); j++) {
                // The 'if (i != j)' check is redundant here because 'j' always starts from 'i + 1',
                // guaranteeing 'j' is never equal to 'i'. It doesn't harm correctness but can be removed.
                // if (i != j) { // Redundant check
                
                    string str1 = words[i]; // Alias for the first string in the pair
                    string str2 = words[j]; // Alias for the second string in the pair
                    
                    // Core logic to check if str1 is both a prefix AND a suffix of str2:
                    // 1. str1 must not be longer than str2. If it is, it cannot be a prefix or suffix.
                    // 2. str2.substr(0, str1.size()) == str1: Checks if str1 matches the beginning of str2.
                    // 3. str2.substr(str2.size() - str1.size()) == str1: Checks if str1 matches the end of str2.
                    if (str1.size() <= str2.size() && 
                        str2.substr(0, str1.size()) == str1 && 
                        str2.substr(str2.size() - str1.size()) == str1) {
                        ctr++; // Increment counter if all conditions are met
                    }
                // } // End redundant check
            }
        }
        return ctr; // Return the total count
    }
};
```

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1.  **Initialization:** `int ctr = 0;` sets up a counter.
2.  **Outer Loop (`i`):** It iterates from the first word (`words[0]`) up to the second-to-last word (`words[words.size()-2]`). This word `words[i]` is `str1`.
3.  **Inner Loop (`j`):** For each `words[i]`, this loop starts from `words[i+1]` to `words[words.size()-1]`. This ensures that we only consider pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`, as required by the problem. This `words[j]` is `str2`.
4.  **Redundant Check (`if (i != j)`):** This condition is always true because `j` is initialized to `i+1`. It can be safely removed for cleaner code.
5.  **String Aliases:** `string str1 = words[i]; string str2 = words[j];` copies the strings. For very small string lengths (max 10 characters), this overhead is negligible. Using `const std::string&` references would avoid copies but is not strictly necessary for performance here.
6.  **`isPrefixAndSuffix` Logic:** This is the heart of the check.
    *   `str1.size() <= str2.size()`: This is a crucial initial check. If the potential prefix/suffix (`str1`) is longer than the target string (`str2`), it's impossible for `str1` to be a prefix or suffix of `str2`. This prunes invalid cases early.
    *   `str2.substr(0, str1.size()) == str1`: This checks the prefix condition. `substr(0, length)` extracts a substring starting from index 0 of the given `length`. If this extracted part is equal to `str1`, then `str1` is a prefix.
    *   `str2.substr(str2.size() - str1.size()) == str1`: This checks the suffix condition. `str2.size() - str1.size()` calculates the starting index of the potential suffix in `str2`. `substr(start_index, length)` extracts the substring from that point. If this extracted part is equal to `str1`, then `str1` is a suffix.
    *   All three conditions (length, prefix match, suffix match) must be `true` for `ctr` to be incremented.
7.  **Increment Counter:** `ctr++` if the conditions are met.
8.  **Return:** Finally, `ctr` holds the total count of valid pairs and is returned.

#### 3.2 Alternative Implementations of `isPrefixAndSuffix`

While the core nested loop structure remains the same, the `isPrefixAndSuffix` check itself can be implemented slightly differently:

*   **Using C++20 `std::string::starts_with` and `std::string::ends_with`:**
    If using a C++20 compatible compiler, these methods provide a more concise and readable way to perform prefix and suffix checks. They also implicitly handle the length check (they will return `false` if `str1` is longer than `str2`).

    ```cpp
    // Inside the inner loop:
    // if (words[j].starts_with(words[i]) && words[j].ends_with(words[i])) {
    //     ctr++;
    // }
    ```
    This is functionally equivalent to the `substr` checks for this problem.

*   **Helper Function:** For better modularity and readability, the `isPrefixAndSuffix` logic can be extracted into a separate helper function:

    ```cpp
    class Solution {
    private:
        // Helper function to check if s1 is both a prefix and a suffix of s2
        bool check(const std::string& s1, const std::string& s2) {
            // Handle the case where s1 is longer than s2
            if (s1.length() > s2.length()) {
                return false;
            }
            // Check if s1 is a prefix of s2
            bool isPrefix = (s2.rfind(s1, 0) == 0); // s2.starts_with(s1) in C++20
            // Check if s1 is a suffix of s2
            bool isSuffix = (s2.rfind(s1) == s2.length() - s1.length()); // s2.ends_with(s1) in C++20
            
            return isPrefix && isSuffix;
        }
        // Note: Using substr is more direct for specific length comparison.
        // The original provided solution's substr approach is perfectly fine and often clearer
        // than rfind for fixed-length prefix/suffix checks.
        /*
        bool isPrefixAndSuffix(const std::string& str1, const std::string& str2) {
            if (str1.size() > str2.size()) {
                return false;
            }
            return (str2.substr(0, str1.size()) == str1) &&
                   (str2.substr(str2.size() - str1.size()) == str1);
        }
        */
    public:
        int countPrefixSuffixPairs(std::vector<std::string>& words) {
            int count = 0;
            int n = words.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                    // if (isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j])) { // Using the helper function
                    if (check(words[i], words[j])) { // Using the helper function with rfind example
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            return count;
        }
    };
    ```

### 4. Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Let `N` be the number of words in the `words` array (`words.length`), and `L` be the maximum length of any string in the `words` array (`words[i].length`).

*   **Constraints:**
    *   `N <= 50`
    *   `L <= 10`

#### 4.1 Naive (Brute-Force) Approach (Provided Solution)

*   **Time Complexity:** `O(N^2 * L)`
    *   The outer loop runs `N` times.
    *   The inner loop runs approximately `N` times (specifically, `N-1` for `i=0`, `N-2` for `i=1`, ..., `1` for `i=N-2`). This results in `N * (N-1) / 2` pairs, which is `O(N^2)` pairs in total.
    *   Inside the innermost part, for each pair `(words[i], words[j])`, we perform string operations:
        *   `str1.size()` and `str2.size()` are `O(1)`.
        *   `str2.substr()`: Creating a substring of length `L` takes `O(L)` time. This is done twice.
        *   String comparison (`==`): Comparing two strings of length `L` takes `O(L)` time in the worst case. This is done twice.
        *   Therefore, the check for each pair takes `O(L)` time.
    *   Total time complexity: `O(N^2 * L)`.
    *   With `N=50` and `L=10`, the number of operations is roughly `50^2 * 10 = 2500 * 10 = 25,000`. This is extremely fast and well within typical time limits (usually 10^8 operations per second).

*   **Space Complexity:** `O(L)`
    *   The variables `str1` and `str2` (and temporary strings created by `substr`) store copies of the strings being compared. The maximum length of these strings is `L`.
    *   Thus, the auxiliary space used is proportional to the maximum string length, `O(L)`.

#### 4.2 Optimized Approaches (Conceptual, not practically faster for these constraints)

*   Any Trie-based or hashing approach would generally have higher constant factors and setup costs. For example, building Tries might take `O(N*L)` and then searching or querying could involve `O(N*L)` or `O(N*L^2)` depending on the exact strategy for finding all pairs. However, for `N=50, L=10`, this is unlikely to outperform the brute-force `O(N^2*L)` solution.

### 5. Edge Cases and How They Are Handled

*   **`words.length = 1`:**
    *   **How it's handled:** The outer loop `for (int i=0; i<words.size(); i++)` will execute for `i=0`. The inner loop `for (int j=i+1; j<words.size(); j++)` will immediately terminate because `j` starts at `i+1` (which is `1`), and `words.size()` is `1`, so `1 < 1` is false.
    *   **Correctness:** The counter `ctr` remains `0`. This is correct, as no pairs `(i, j)` with `i < j` can be formed from a single word.

*   **`str1` and `str2` are identical (e.g., `words = ["a", "a"]`):**
    *   **How it's handled:** When `i=0, j=1`, `str1 = "a", str2 = "a"`.
        *   `str1.size() <= str2.size()` (1 <= 1) is true.
        *   `str2.substr(0, 1) == "a"` is true.
        *   `str2.substr(1 - 1, 1) == "a"` (i.e., `str2.substr(0, 1) == "a"`) is true.
        *   All conditions are met, `ctr` increments.
    *   **Correctness:** This is correct as a string is both a prefix and a suffix of itself.

*   **`str1.size() == str2.size()` (but `str1 != str2`):**
    *   **How it's handled:** e.g., `str1 = "ab"`, `str2 = "ac"`.
        *   `str1.size() <= str2.size()` (2 <= 2) is true.
        *   `str2.substr(0, 2) == "ab"` (i.e., `"ac" == "ab"`) is false.
        *   The condition fails, `ctr` does not increment.
    *   **Correctness:** Correct. For a string `str1` of the same length as `str2` to be both a prefix and suffix, `str1` must be identical to `str2`.

*   **`str1.size() > str2.size()`:**
    *   **How it's handled:** e.g., `str1 = "abc"`, `str2 = "ab"`.
        *   The first check `str1.size() <= str2.size()` (3 <= 2) is false.
        *   The `if` condition immediately evaluates to false, and `ctr` is not incremented.
    *   **Correctness:** Correct. A longer string cannot be a prefix or suffix of a shorter string.

*   **Empty strings in `words`:**
    *   **How it's handled:** The problem constraints state `1 <= words[i].length`, meaning no empty strings will be present in the input.

### 7. Key Insights and Patterns

1.  **Constraint Analysis is Crucial:** The small constraints (`N <= 50`, `L <= 10`) are the most important insight. They immediately indicate that a brute-force approach (`O(N^2 * L)`) will be perfectly acceptable, preventing over-engineering with complex data structures or algorithms that would be needed for larger inputs.
2.  **Iterating Pairs with `i < j`:** The standard pattern for counting or processing pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` from an array `arr` is:
    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.size(); ++j) {
            // Process (arr[i], arr[j])
        }
    }
    ```
    This ensures each unique pair is considered exactly once.
3.  **String Prefix/Suffix Checks:**
    *   **Manual `substr`:** `str.substr(0, len) == prefix_str` for prefix, `str.substr(str.size() - len, len) == suffix_str` for suffix. Remember to pre-check `len <= str.size()`.
    *   **C++20 `starts_with`/`ends_with`:** These are more readable and handle the length check automatically. If available, prefer them.
    *   **Edge Case: `str1` same length as `str2`:** If `str1.length() == str2.length()`, then for `str1` to be a prefix and suffix of `str2`, `str1` must be exactly equal to `str2`. The provided logic correctly handles this case.
4.  **Problem Decomposition:** Breaking down the `isPrefixAndSuffix` condition into a separate helper function improves code readability, maintainability, and testability, even for simple conditions.
5.  **Simplicity over Complexity:** For problems with small constraints, prioritize clarity and correctness with a straightforward approach. Avoid premature optimization or using complex algorithms if a simpler one fits the constraints. This is a common pitfall in competitive programming.
